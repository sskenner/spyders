https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/building-envelope-architect/6247382113.html,Building Envelope Architect,TriBeCa,"One of New York City's leading professional firms dedicated to the restoration and renovation of buildings and infrastructure is currently seeking an architect with  2 to 5 years of relevant experience. 

SUPERSTRUCTURES works on an array of challenging projects on many of New York's most prominent buildings. We've won frequent awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region -- public, corporate and residential.  Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls.  

We work in teams. Teams are assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a ""small office experience"" coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state of the art non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques.  

Employees typically participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see the designs you draw executed in the field, and you'll take on greater responsibility and client exposure as soon as you are ready.  

Frequent lunchtime seminars by industry experts, including our own in-house personnel, keep us current on developments in the profession (with the additional benefit of a free lunch).  

SUPERSTRUCTURES offers top-level compensation for top-level people, and the advancement potential of a thriving company.  

We are committed to a work / life balance, and to a work week of 40 hours.  When, on occasion, more than 40 hours are required, our employees are compensated for every additional hour worked. 
Our benefits include paid holidays, vacation and sick days, health insurance for employee and family, 401(k) with automatic employer contribution, a continuing education allowance, and free NYC Transit MetroCards.  

Our light-filled office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and drop dead views in three directions - not a bad place to spend the workday. 

Our Tribeca location is one of New York City's most convenient and vibrant, easily accessible via public transportation. The A, C, and E subway lines stop right in the building. The N, R, #1, and #6 lines are each just a few blocks away. 

SUPERSTRUCTURES welcomes applications in reply to this posting. Please include a cover letter with salary requirements, your resume, and a few pages of attachments that display your capabilities (maximum of 10MB please).

About the Salvadori Center:

When the New York Academy of Sciences challenged educators in 1976 to improve the teaching of math and science in middle schools, Salvadori's founder responded.  He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.
In 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:

•	Engage students through project-based exercises
•	Use the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science
•	Employ collaborative problem solving that involves all learners

Today, we hold true to our founding principles.  Salvadori's programs celebrate our collaborative, hands-on and project-based approach to learning through the built environment with programs that:

•	Promote college and career readiness for all students
•	Emphasize higher-order skills
•	Produce student work that reflects high levels of thinking, participation, and ownership

We offer a variety of multi-day in-school and after-school programs that enable every child to succeed, as well as professional development workshops that provide teachers with a strong foundation in project-based learning.  All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.

After participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand ""why they need to know this.""

Salvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.

Compensation Package:

•	Salary: $42,000 (increased to $46,200 after a successful first year)
•	52 leave days a year
o	15 vacation days
o	16 holidays
o	2 personal days
o	9 sick days
o	10 days' summer leave (typically two consecutive weeks in August)

About the Salvadori Center:

When the New York Academy of Sciences challenged educators in 1976 to improve the teaching of math and science in middle schools, Salvadori's founder responded.  He showed students how math and science are part of the buildings, bridges, and communities that surround us.
In 1987, the Salvadori Center was founded with three main principles:

•	Engage students through project-based exercises
•	Use the built environment to illustrate the relevance of math and science
•	Employ collaborative problem solving that involves all learners

Today, we hold true to our founding principles.  Salvadori's programs celebrate our collaborative, hands-on and project-based approach to learning through the built environment with programs that:

•	Promote college and career readiness for all students
•	Emphasize higher-order skills
•	Produce student work that reflects high levels of thinking, participation, and ownership

We offer a variety of multi-day in-school and after-school programs that enable every child to succeed, as well as professional development workshops that provide teachers with a strong foundation in project-based learning.  All Salvadori curricula link to Common Core Learning Standards, Next Generation Science Standards, Blueprint for Teaching and Learning in the Arts, and grade-specific learning objectives.

After participating in Salvadori programs, thousands of students see their world differently.  They understand how buildings stand up, how bridges support such heavy loads and, most importantly, they understand ""why they need to know this.""

Salvadori students achieve a greater understanding of math and science than students in traditional learning environments; they see it and feel it in the classes they enter, the bridges they cross, and the communities they live in.

As our business has grown, we have been repeatedly offered more jobs that would require partnership with a licensed architect. In many instances, we have turned those jobs down, which from a business perspective, is not ideal. As a rule, we like to get new business - not turn it away!  

The perfect person we envision would be a young (or maybe not so young), independent architect who may just be getting started in the profession, is looking to take on some side work that is not too demanding, maybe learn a little more about the ""system"" and make some contacts that would help your business expand. The work you do would be reasonably profitable with the chance  to earn a little extra to pay the bills. This is a potential opportunity to grow with us. We would like to bring on more work like this and have the opportunity and means to do that if we find the right architect  to work with. We also place significant value on the relationships we have with our small network of professionals. We have a tight group that passes work off to each other. So if you would like to take on more work, we will attempt to bring it on. If you think this is something that appeals to you, please contact me and we will discuss. I would appreciate a simple resume if you have one. If not, just outline your work experience, education, what you doing now, etc. All the standard things. 

I look forward to hearing from you.
