Strong experience in Android (Java) is preferred and familiarity with iOS and Objective C is a plus. Strong communication and documentation skills are needed to help make each integration easy to configure and use. This has the potential to be a long-term project building out a rich ecosystem of integrations on multiple platforms. Note: There is no set contract length. The first integration will take 2-4 weeks and if the contract goes well, it could easily turn into 6 - 12 months of work.",
