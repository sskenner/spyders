   Tackling litigation with technology is a surprisingly deep challenge, and it requires in-depth computer science, including machine learning, data visualization, search, distributed systems, databases, real-time collaboration, nifty user interfaces, and more.

   We're looking for full-stack generalists. We value great CS fundamentals, native ability, and humility, over experience with any particular platform, technology, or specialization. If you happen to have a specialty, we'll put that to use -- but we won't restrict you to that area.

   We care a lot about finding the best engineers, writing correct software, using the right tools for the job, and avoiding dogma. As a result we've been able to build quite a bit of sophisticated technology with a small, talented team. It's the kind of culture where you'll own serious features, write great code, learn a huge amount, and have a lot of fun.

   We code primarily in Java, TypeScript and Python.

Requirements

     * Experience with a compiled language, such as C, C++, or Java
     * Good knowledge of algorithms and fundamental computer science concepts
     * A love of building systems
     * An eye for aesthetics and user experience
     * An eagerness to learn new technologies
     * Authorization to work in the United States; please note that at this time, Everlaw is not sponsoring visas for any positions.

Plusses

     * BS or MS in Computer Science, or equivalent coursework
     * Scripting language experience (Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.)
     * UNIX-itude
     * Good writing and communication skills

Benefits

     * Competitive salary
     * Substantial equity
     * Retirement plan with company matching
     * Health, dental, and vision insurance
     * Maternity, paternity, and sick leave
     * Fifteen paid vacation days, plus ten bankable federal holidays

Perks

     * Work in downtown Berkeley, just steps from the BART line and dozens of restaurants
     * Select your own hardware and customize your desk setup
     * Bond over team lunches and out-of-the-box events
     * Take advantage of learning and career development opportunities
     * Voted one of "San Francisco Bay Area's Best and Brightest Companies" to work for

   To date, our team of a dozen full-stack engineers has been managing this infrastructure. We are looking for someone to own the administration of our architecture as Everlaw grows. We have a history of building reliable software (we have averaged 99.9% uptime since 2014). Youll help us keep it that way -- and get even better -- as we expand our offerings and host orders of magnitude more data.

     * New release deployments
     * Aiding in critical issue resolution as needed (during work hours or otherwise)

Requirements

     * 2+ years experience administering a cloud environment
     * Extensive scripting and Unix experience
     * An obsession with automation and process improvement
     * Excellent communication and collaboration skills
     * Comfort with administering an always-on platform
     * Initiative and autonomy
     * A commitment to security best practices
     * Authorization to work in the United States; please note that at this time, Everlaw is not sponsoring visas for any positions.

Plusses

     * Expertise in one or more compiled languages
     * Desire to document
     * Specific expertise in Amazon Web Services

Benefits

     * Relocation assistance will be provided to those coming from outside of the SF Bay Area.
     * Competitive salary
     * Substantial equity
     * Retirement plan with company matching
     * Health, dental, and vision insurance
     * Maternity, paternity, and sick leave
     * Fifteen paid vacation days, plus ten bankable federal holidays

Perks

     * Work in downtown Berkeley, just steps from the BART line and dozens of restaurants
     * Select your own hardware and customize your desk setup
     * Bond over team lunches and out-of-the-box events

   ===== About Upserve =====
   Upserve is the industry's leading full-service Restaurant Management Platform. In a single platform, Upserve offers the market-leading cloud point of sale for restaurants, actionable analytics, and seamless integration with leading third-party restaurant apps. Thousands of restaurants use Upserve to manage relationships with more than 32 million active diners, and to serve over 23 million meals per month.

   Upserve is headquartered in Providence with additional offices in San Francisco and New York City. We believe that culture is a competitive advantage, and treat it as such -- our values of One Team, Impact, Empathy, Openness, Curiosity and Grit guide our daily actions. Learn more about what that means from our blog - https://upserve.com/inside-upserve - or by following us on Twitter and Instagram (@InsideUpserve).

   ===== About the Role =====
   We are seeking a talented Engineer to join our infrastructure team. This group includes some of our top coders, who want to do more and go faster. They are obsessed with automation, and play a critical role improving the tools that keep our products running smoothly. They enable our developers to execute quickly, and strive to maximize product uptime while minimizing developer lag. Our Infrastructure Engineers are also the first line of defense when identifying and diagnosing challenging performance issues, and they play a key role in shaping the direction of Upserves engineering processes.

   If you're a pragmatic idealist -- you strive for efficient and practical solutions not just theoretically ideal ones, and have a passion for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and operating system internals and databases -- then come join the team!

   ===== The Right Ingredients =====
   Upserve's engineering organization aims to minimize the impacts of Conways law by organizing into small teams that can drive from concept to production. Additionally - we ship fast and ship often. Our best engineers are big believers in moving fast with high quality; Speed and craftsmanship are friends not enemies. We do 100s of deploys a week, and some of the technologies in our stack include React / React Native, Kinesis, DynamoDB, Machine Learning, RedShift, RDS, Ruby, JavaScript, Docker, ECS, Java, Redis, and more.

   Qualifications
   - Proven experience building correct, well-tested systems and components, and driving clarity even given loose direction and requirements.
   - Expertise in continuous software delivery and integration. You should have prior experience building, optimizing, and scaling real-time, event-driven, fault-tolerant, and distributed systems.
   - Outstanding programming skills, and experience with server-side frameworks like Ruby on Rails.
   - Experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS), operating system internals, filesystems, databases, and networks.
   - Knowledge of when to employ different storage technologies (e.g. relational, simple file-based, graph-based, noSQL).

   ===== Upserve's "Mise En Place" =====
   Above all else, all Upserve employees are united in our shared passion for the hospitality industry, our product, and the impact we can have on the owners and operators we serve. We have a track record of success, with 100%+ growth in the last 3 years. How do we do it? By providing great value to our customers, and by relentlessly focusing on the details - our Mise En Place (everything in its place).
   - Our Net Promoter Scores over the last six months are higher than any other SMB software company
   - Our SaaS 'quick ratio' and LTV to CAC is exceeding 4x, making us leaders in the market
   - Our newest product features enjoy ~70% weekly active users and nearly 50% daily active users.
   - Our leadership hails from top companies like OpenTable, TellMe, BrightCove, Microsoft, and McKinsey.
   - Our Board and Investment Partners include Vista Equity Partners, First Round, and Pritzker.

   But our focus on excellence doesn't stop there. We offer competitive employee, including the following:
   - 100% paid medical and dental coverage with the leading provider nation-wide
   - Unlimited Time Off - our policy is "take the time you need, when you need it"
   - A "family first" culture, with generous paid parental and caregiver leave
   - 401(k) with built-in financial advisory services
   - Quarterly wellness weeks, focused on mental, emotional AND physical health
   - Catered healthy lunches daily, as well as organic healthy snacks in our office.
   - On-Site dry cleaning pick-up for those who want it...and a flexible "come dressed" policy for others!
   - Multiple social clubs, including intramural sport leagues and a monthly "supper club"

   Last but not least, Upserve is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer! Beyond that, we also care deeply about creating a culture of inclusion, and about improving diversity in tech. We believe in being color brave, not color blind, and partner with a number of local organizations working to improve access to the tech industry for underrepresented groups. These include Project Include, Girls Who Code, Providence IntraCity Geeks, #HackPVD, Code.org, PVD Lady Project, and Rosie's Girls to name a few.

   ===== About Upserve =====
   Upserve is the industry's leading full-service Restaurant Management Platform. In a single platform, Upserve offers the market-leading cloud point of sale for restaurants, actionable analytics, and seamless integration with leading third-party restaurant apps. Thousands of restaurants use Upserve to manage relationships with more than 32 million active diners, and to serve over 23 million meals per month.

   Upserve is headquartered in Providence with additional offices in San Francisco and New York City.

Learn more about what that means from our blog - https://upserve.com/inside-upserve - or by following us on Twitter and Instagram (@InsideUpserve).

   ===== About the Role =====
   As a JavaScript Engineer, youll play a pivotal role in architecting, expanding, and evolving unified experiences across our products. You'll work alongside senior engineers and product managers in a small, focused team, as part of a geographically dispersed, product-centric and agile environment.

   Day to day, this means:
   - Collaborating with our product and UX team to develop interfaces and clarify product requirements.
   - Balancing issue and bug resolution, platform improvements and new feature builds.
   - Contributing to and informally mentoring other engineers by contributing to PR feedback.

   ===== The Right Ingredients =====
   For this role, you have to be passionate about frequently shipping intuitive, quality products to large numbers of end users. You also need a keen eye for design and thoughtful user experiences - all with an eye towards both online and offline operations. Lastly, you need strong debugging skills to support full lifecycle product ownership. As a proven collaborator, you should be able to excel within focused teams and gel well with Designers and Product Managers.

   The ideal candidate for this role is proficient with Javascript and has experience with the following:
   - JavaScript-centric applications (such as React, React Native, Elm, Babel)
   - Functional Programming methodologies
   - Upholding high-bar of UX principles and technical trade-offs
   - GraphQL and JSON APIs
   - Git and GitHub workflows
   - Offline device operation and data synchronization considerations
   - Writing testable code, and using Continuous Integration tools
   - Android and iOS development experience a plus

   ===== Upserve's "Mise En Place" =====
   Above all else, all Upserve employees are united in our shared passion for the hospitality industry, our product, and the impact we can have on the owners and operators we serve. We have a track record of success, with 100%+ growth in the last 3 years. How do we do it? By providing great value to our customers, and by relentlessly focusing on the details - our Mise En Place (everything in its place).
   - Our Net Promoter Scores over the last six months are higher than any other SMB software company
   - Our SaaS 'quick ratio' and LTV to CAC is exceeding 4x, making us leaders in the market
   - Our newest product features enjoy ~70% weekly active users and nearly 50% daily active users.
   - Our leadership hails from top companies like OpenTable, TellMe, BrightCove, Microsoft, and McKinsey.
   - Our Board and Investment Partners include Vista Equity Partners, First Round, and Pritzker.

   But our focus on excellence doesn't stop there. We offer competitive employee, including the following:
   - 100% paid medical and dental coverage with the leading provider nation-wide
   - Unlimited Time Off - our policy is "take the time you need, when you need it"
   - A "family first" culture, with generous paid parental and caregiver leave
   - 401(k) with built-in financial advisory services
   - Quarterly wellness weeks, focused on mental, emotional AND physical health
   - Catered healthy lunches daily, as well as organic healthy snacks in our office.
   - On-Site dry cleaning pick-up for those who want it...and a flexible "come dressed" policy for others!
   - Multiple social clubs, including intramural sport leagues and a monthly "supper club"

   Last but not least, Upserve is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer! Beyond that, we also care deeply about creating a culture of inclusion, and about improving diversity in tech. We believe in being color brave, not color blind, and partner with a number of local organizations working to improve access to the tech industry for underrepresented groups. These include Project Include, Girls Who Code, Providence IntraCity Geeks, #HackPVD, Code.org, PVD Lady Project, and Rosie's Girls to name a few.

   If you're motivated by growth and impact, Credit Karma is one of the best places to work in tech today. We are growing our product beyond credit scores (e.g. Credit Karma Tax) and are well-positioned to become the main touchpoint for consumer finance, but there is so much work left to do!

We have a wide array of challenges from building scalable systems to support new product features, decomposing our legacy PHP application into microservices that can work in concert to help our members, to launching new experiences on both desktop and mobile web.

Some of the experiences as a full-stack engineer include:

     * Partnering with Product, Design, and other engineering teams to deliver great user experiences
     * Writing front-end code in React + Redux
     * Creating reusable React components that will be used across our products
     * Building new services in Node.js and Scala
     * Identifying ways to improve our technology and process
     * Building internal APIs in Thrift and client-facing APIs in GraphQL
     * Participating in code and technical design reviews
