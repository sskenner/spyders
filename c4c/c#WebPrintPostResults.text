   The Desktop Modeler team develops our IDE, the Mendix Modeler, creating high-tech software with an easy-to-use interface. You will use both your excellent C# skills and Model-Driven Development techniques to deliver new features and improve product quality.

You're the innovator we need if:

     * You're fluent in C# and functional aspects like lambdas and generics, and you're also not afraid of other languages, design patterns, and technologies like WPF and DI containers.
     * You like to learn from highly motivated and capable colleagues and in turn share your knowledge.

     * We're flexible in adopting new technologies and methodologies if that makes the product better or our lives easier. Each scrum team is free to choose its own tech stack, so you can always try that latest new idea, framework or design pattern. Our teams are small so that you can have a real influence. We care about open standards, and we're also big fans of Test-Driven Development. We're constantly improving our Continuous Integration process, which monitors the quality of our product and makes the lives of our developers and testers easier.
     * Every month, we have crafting days when developers are invited to work on whatever they want. For example, people work on a bug that somehow never got prioritized, try out a cool new technology that may be useful to us (now or in the future), build an automated goal counting mechanism for the football table, or a Lego Mindstorms setup to control the elevator.
     * We like people who take ownership, and try to give everyone as much freedom as possible. This means there's as little process as we can get away with, because we don't want to get in your way. We also strive to stay as flat as possible. Do you have an issue? Walk right into our CTO's office and bring it up. Even though our client base consists of large enterprises, we do not allow a bureaucratic culture to enter our R&D department. We value the start-up culture that has brought us so much success. We are a tech company, not a project-oriented organization.

   Job Description

   We are looking for self-motivated engineers to join our team to help take our product to the next level. You will have the opportunity to work on various interesting projects - from mobile development and platform design to server operations and deployment, and everything in between. Be ready to enhance the team by bringing your unique knowledge to the table, and we will enhance your skills by doing the same and challenging you to learn more.

   We are polyglots at our core, and like to use the right language for the job. To this end, much of our architecture is constructed as micro-services. This is something that can, of course, be improved upon and refined. Our core technologies include MongoDB, Ruby, Node.js, Kafka, and ElasticSearch. On the mobile side we also use Objective-C, Java (both for Android and back-end), C#, and client-side JavaScript. Our platform is fully run on top of AWS in a highly secure environment that we manage.

As a successful candidate, you:

     * Develop high-quality software design and architecture.
     * Identify, prioritize and execute tasks in the software development life cycle.
     * Develop tools and applications by producing clean, efficient code.
     * Review and debug code.
     * Automate develop processes by creating code generators and automate deployment using tools such as puppet, chef, and octopus.
     * Perform unit and integration testing.
     * Collaborate with internal teams and vendors to fix and improve products.
     * Document logical and physical architecture.
     * Ensure software is up-to-date with latest technologies.

Qualifications (some, not necessarily all)

     * At least 4+ years of experience developing applications with a proven record of success.
     * Knowledge of Ruby on Rails, Node.js, JavaScript, or CoffeeScript.
     * Knowledge of relational databases (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL databases (e.g. MongoDB).
     * Knowledge of microsservices architecture as well as other architecture design patterns with a proven record of developing scalable APIs.
     * Knowledge of Agile practices and roles such as product owner, engineer, scrum master, and quality assurance.
     * Knowledge of building applications using AWS specifically around S3, EC2, auto-scaling tools, and monitoring.
     * Exposure to using system monitoring tools and automated testing frameworks.
     * Familiarity with various operating systems (Linux, Mac OS, Windows)
     * Ability to work independently.
     * Excellent organizational and leadership skills.
     * Proven work experience in software development.
     * Proficient using distributed source control systems.
     * Strong problem-solving skills and willingness to roll up one's sleeves to get the job.
     * Skilled at working effectively with cross functional teams in a matrix organization.
     * Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
     * MS/BS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or equivalent preferred.

   As an employee of CloudMine, this position includes tasks and responsibilities that involve maintaining security of company assets, confidentiality of data and reliability of systems.  All employees will receive and acknowledge security policies and handbook.  All employees will receive training on security awareness, and other security procedures. Violation of security policy may result in disciplinary actions.

   A member of technical staff is a key participant of CloudMine security processes.   As a member of this team, your position will require signing a Privileged Access Agreement in accordance with rights and permissions that may be granted to CloudMine systems.

   CloudMine is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.

One of the key responsibilities of our team is to work with Engineers and Product experts across the organization to push the business forward.  Most importantly, you'll provide key technical expertise that helps the team grow and succeed.

   THE TECH STACK
   Our primary stack is Python and Django, all running on Amazon AWS with a MySQL backend. Some of the other tools that we use are Hive, Spark, Kafka, Redis, ElasticSearch, React, Git, and an endless supply of coffee.

THE SKILL SET

   THE CHALLENGE
   Last year at Eventbrite organizers created 3 million events and we processed 150 million tickets. Behind all of those tickets and events is a number of teams working together to keep our product scalable and available as we grow. The Segment Services team is responsible for a number of the core services that help make Eventbrite successful, and we want you to be a part of that success.

   THE TEAM
   Our team  is responsible for the APIs and services that our organizers depend upon. We have a few core services that are our primary responsibility, but we also work closely with other teams to help them meet their needs and goals. Getting to work this team means getting to touch a wide array of the pieces that make up Eventbrite. You can learn more about the team from some of our engineers.

   THE ROLE
   In this role you'll work closely with a small team of bright, dedicated engineers improving some of our most core services, and providing valuable feedback to the rest of the company about the work they're doing against these services. In addition to that, you'll develop features and APIs needed by other feature teams to meet their goals. This role will be instrumental in making the Eventbrite experience a good one for our organizers and customers.

   THE TECH STACK
   Eventbrite's primary tech stack is Python, Django, and MySQL, all running on AWS, and this is the main sandbox we play in. However, because this team interfaces with many other teams, there's potential to many other pieces of our broader tech stack (Redis, Cassandra, Kafka, ElasticSearch, etc).

THE SKILL SET

     * 3+ years building applications in a mainstream programming language: Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, C++, Java, etc.
     * 2+ years of experience using some form of web framework: Django, Symphony, Rails, ASP.net, etc.
     * 2+ years of experience using a SQL database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, etc
     * Efficient, practical programmer with a record of producing dependable code
     * You care about making sure your code is maintainable and well tested
     * You bring knowledge of TDD and do it in your day to day
     * A result driven self starter with great communication and collaboration skills, we put a lot of emphasis on being team players
     * Passion to learn and to teach/mentor others

BONUS POINTS

     * You have knowledge of microservices and/or Service Oriented Architecture
     * You have experience working with modern frontend frameworks: React, Backbone/Marionette, etc
     * You have experience designing and developing APIs, both internal service and HTTP APIs

   The Role
   We're looking for an experienced engineer to join our team at Eaze. As a back end engineer, you'll help shape the platform that powers the Eaze web and mobile apps. We like to iterate quickly, so engineers are involved early in the product design process. Once we begin prototyping and moving towards release, you'll own and ship your own code on infrastructure you help automate and maintain. You'll be involved in each step of the process from design to deployment, including monitoring and scaling.

   What We're Looking For
   Our core JSON API and many of our supporting tools are written in Javascript and C#, so having experience with Node.js or .NET is a plus. Have no fear if you're not an expert in either of these--we love engineers who can rapidly learn the right language or tool in order to solve the problem at hand. Some of our ongoing challenges include real-time driver tracking and routing, dynamic product suggestions and of course scaling our system to accommodate our exponentially growing user base.

   A Little About Us
   We have a friendly, welcoming environment and a team that cares about diversity and inclusion. We're funded, which means we can offer competitive salaries and benefits, quality gear, and unlimited snacks. We're also still small and growing, so there's opportunity to grow with us.

   About Eaze:
