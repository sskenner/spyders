   Neuralink is developing ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers. We're building a team of multidisciplinary experts and doers who are dedicated to changing the world.

   We need a diverse, core group of engineers to design, fabricate, and test next-generation medical robotics. We want embedded engineers with specialities, hybrid mechanical-software-electricals engineers, generalists and people we haven't thought of yet. The ideal candidates are people who get excited about building things, are highly analytical, and enjoy tackling new problems regularly. Our robotics integrate actuated devices with microelectromechanical systems as well as novel surgical procedures. These applications place strong emphasis on high-precision, high-repeatability mechanical motion, as well as high reliability and fail-safe design.  Projects you might work on include writing the code that runs "on head" mediating between the physical bio-device interface and the high level software interfaces, or writing low-level robotics control software to drive sophisticated novel neurosurgical robotics, among many other possibilities.

About you:

     * You excel at your strengths (whether that is BIOS, integration, design, drivers or something else.)
     * You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.
     * You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.
     * You are a cross disciplinary team member. You are excited to work with and learn from neuroscientists and nanotechnologists. You are comfortable communicating across teams.

Technical nice to haves:

     * (We are growing a diverse team of engineers, so no one person has to have all of these!)
     * Experience with ARM, x86, assembly, system BIOS and hardware/software integration.
     * Programming experience on Linux in Python, C, C++, Verilog, or VHDL.
     * Familiarity setting up embedded toolchains, build, and debugging environments.
     * Experience with Wi-Fi, BLE, USB, TCP/IP stacks in an embedded environment.

What we offer:

     * An opportunity to change the world and work with some of the smartest people you will ever meet.
     * Growth Potential. We rapidly advance people who have an outsize impact.
     * Flexible PTO policy.
     * Excellent medical, dental and vision insurance through a PPO plan.
     * 401k
     * Lunch and snacks while at work
     * Competitive pay and stock options

     * Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. You enjoy collaboration with others--our work isn't carried out in a vacuum, and everyone contributes to get the job done.
     * Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
     * Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision. You understand that making mistakes means you're learning, and you actively seek opportunities to grow and develop.
     * You want to work on software that is changing the world and you're passionate about creating intuitive, scalable products that magnify the analytical capabilities of our users.

   A World-Changing Company

   At Palantir, we're passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

   The Role

   Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers' greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.

   FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers' hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like "Why are we losing customers?" or "How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?" FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.

   You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world's most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers.

Technologies We Use

     * Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments
     * Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms
     * Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing
     * Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools
     * Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies
     * Python for data processing and analysis
     * Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3

Our Principles

     * Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.
     * Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
     * Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds -- such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
     * Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities--we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.
     * Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.
     * Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.

What We Value

     * Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.
     * Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
     * Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you're building.
     * Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
     * Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
     * Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
     * Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.

   Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

   We also feel it's important to point out the obvious here - there's a serious lack of diversity in our industry and it needs to change. Our goal is to help drive that change. We hope to continue to build a company whose culture promotes inclusion and embraces how rewarding it is to work with engineers from all walks of life. Making biology easier to engineer is a tough nut to crack - we can't afford to leave any talent untapped.

   It is the policy of Ginkgo Bioworks to provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and employment applicants.

Our team members are likely to say that their contribution makes a difference and their thinking matters to their teammates and to the company's leadership.

   Our goal as a business is to provide the most complete, effective, and fun way for people to be together when they are not in the same physical space. Our goal as an employer is to provide the same, in the real world, every day, for the great folks we hire!

   As a technology company, our long-term success is dependent on the skill and alignment of our engineering team. We develop groundbreaking scientific software and rely on our engineers to bring the company's vision to fruition. Every engineer has the opportunity to make huge product contributions and the responsibility to be a Tachyon, i.e. move faster than the speed of light.

   Our core physics and data science algorithms are written in Matlab and F# and they integrate closely with our full stack web environment running in F#, a functional-first, multiparadigm language. Our data engineering team bridges the gap between pure research code and production-quality algorithms, often scaling up code to run faster, on more computers, and more reliably. The team is also responsible for building the underlying science test framework, grooming and maintaining physically accurate test data, and ensuring ongoing scientific accuracy of analyses and predictions. We seek engineers who are excited to do product-driven thinking, grounded in hard core physics and statistics.

Responsibilities

     * Bridge gaps between the research team and the platform software engineers.
     * Design correctness tests for both physics-based and statistics-based models and predictive systems.
     * Build systems to evaluate the quality of input and output data on an ongoing basis, including (especially) data coming from customer systems.
     * Make and communicate architectural decisions in areas of expertise.
     * Expand and improve scientific test environment, test data, and processes.
     * Rapidly iterate in the cycle of code writing, testing, and maintenance.
     * Contribute to our various client and server code-bases as our needs evolve.

Requirements

     * 3+ years experience as a professional software developer
     * Strong scientific computing skills (Matlab, Python, and/or F#), preferably with parallel programming and distributed computing
     * Math and science skills, particularly statistics and physics
     * Intense intellectual curiosity demonstrated by past projects and experiences

   As a Back-End/Infrastructure Engineer, you will primarily serve as the gatekeeper to all data at SocialCops. You will abstract away complex data interactions with easy-to-use APIs that will power everything from web applications to an Internet of Things. While data should be easily accessible to those that need it, you must also ensure that it does not fall into the wrong hands.

   Across teams, we will look to you to make key decisions on the technology stack, architecture, networking, and security. We love working with bleeding-edge technology, especially if it reduces development costs with no foreseeable downsides. You will guide us in making the right decisions when it comes to choosing third-party software, bleeding edge or otherwise. You will also own, scale, and maintain the compute and storage infrastructure for the various product teams. These include infrastructure for long running jobs, always up shared or common microservices, and search infrastructure, to name a few.

   The ideal Back-End/Infrastructure Engineers are polyglots who are fluent in HTTP and always pick the right set of tools for the job at hand. They understand what it takes to work in a startup environment and know when to trade performance for development speed. They are critical to the success of many products at SocialCops. They fail fast, learn faster, and execute almost instantly.

   Tech Stack: JavaScript, Node JS and other related JavaScript frameworks

WHY US?

     * Work with a team of Data Scientists, Engineers, Growth Marketers, Designers, and Entrepreneurs, all united by a common mission to drive the most important decisions that will affect humanity.
     * Our fail wall will be your claim to fame.
     * Our gadgets include: 1 Drone, 1 Google Glass, 1 XBOX, 1 Raspberry Pi, and a bunch of cool sensors.
     * Your day job might just end up lifting millions out of poverty or powering the next AIB episode on fire safety.

IN MONTH 1...

     * Week 1 at SocialCops is like being thrown into the deep end of the pool on your very first day at swimming classes. As soon as introductions are over, you are asked to hack on a feature or prototype over the span of a week and show it to everyone at work. After successfully showcasing the hack, you feel like you've officially joined the ranks as an Engineer at SocialCops.
     * You start working on one of the products one feature at a time. With every code sprint, you become familiar with Node.js, HapiJS, Mongo DB, Scala, ElasticSearch, and the many technologies in use at SocialCops.
     * As you hack, you find that parts of the technology stack or the entire stack itself pales in comparison to the ones you have stacked over the years. You make a note to bring it up at the next team meeting. Polyglots + Microservices means Bring Your Own Stack, right?
     * By the end of the month, you have participated in many discussions with almost every individual or team at SocialCops. Discussions ranged from technology stacks to product features to the food menu at the office. You now know to bring a gun to a knife fight, especially when the food menu is up for discussion.

IN MONTH 3...

     * By the third month, you know everyone at the office, even the quiet introverted types. You are up to speed with everything that is being worked on at the office, either through direct participation or via the demos on Friday.
     * You have shipped many features by now and even taught the other engineers quite a few things during the Teach on Tuesday sessions. You've also learned quite a lot from everyone around you.
     * Over the last 3 months, you've come into your own and have now become the go-to person to solve certain classes of problems at the office. That blog post you wrote a few weeks ago is bringing in a lot of traffic to the website and you are tasked with scaling services to handle the increased traffic.

IN MONTH 6 (AND BEYOND)...

     * You hire a couple of engineers to help with the numerous requests for feature additions on a product you are working on.
     * You mentor some of the interns who have joined SocialCops. While showing them the ropes, you learn a whole lot from the experience as well as from the interns themselves. Some of them make it to the Intern Hall of Fame when they leave. But almost all of them leave with their fails on the infamous Fail Wall, right next to some fails by the founders.
     * Over the last 6 months, along with your team of Backend Engineers, you've helped build and scale applications that make our world a better place.

   No algorithm tells mayors the most optimized allocation of city budgets, no tool tells the ministry how to optimize medicine supply chains based on disease outbreak data, and no data set tells whether girl toilets in schools are functional or not. Our decision-making platform is used by over 150 organizations in 18 countries - by mayors to decide budget allocations, by philanthropic organizations to decide strategic investments, by governments to decide sanitation interventions, and by nonprofits to decide on disaster relief measures.

   At Help.com, we want to help eliminate terrible customer service experiences and make good experiences great. Waiting around for agents to locate your account information, lookup a company policy, or see your previous interaction history will become a thing of the past.

   We're just getting started so you have the chance to come in and help us build new products on a small, agile team. Your contributions will be felt immediately and you'll be able to help us shape our products and development path.

   We are predominantly in the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem, but are developing a microservice architecture that gives us immense flexibility in our choice of languages and tools. We take pride in making sure that our APIs are well documented, our code is well tested, and our team understands what we're building and why.

   We're looking for a solid backend developer who has been around the block to help us build out our API driven (micro)services architecture. We're working with the realtime web (websockets) so we have some interesting challenges that you won't see at a pure RESTful HTTP shop.

Some of the following could make you a great fit to work at Help.com

     * You are excited about working at a startup and on a small, talented team.
     * You are excited about JavaScript, Node.js, microservices, and/or messaging systems, and can explain the benefits and detriments of these technology choices.
     * You are active in the open source community or have a desire to start contributing; our software engineers are constantly learning, using, and contributing to open source projects.
     * You care deeply about code quality, performance, and execution, but aren't a dogmatic perfectionist.
     * You don't mind helping out on other areas of the stack if necessary.
     * You are comfortable in an environment where projects are time-sensitive.
     * Adapting to changes in products, projects, and direction won't throw you for a loop.

Qualifications

     * 10+ years experience in development using modern stacks/frameworks/technologies
     * An expert understanding of JavaScript and Node.js
     * Experience with object-oriented and MVC design patterns
     * API design experience
     * Strong understanding of systems using real time interactions (websockets, long-polling, server sent events)
     * Familiarity with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) or Distributed Systems
     * Experience with "Big Data" data stores and technologies (ElasticSearch, Cassandra)
     * Proficiency with a Linux environment
     * Experience with Relational Database Schema Design (preferably PostgreSQL or MySQL)

Nice-to-have skills

     * Experience with Docker
     * Development experience on a SaaS product
     * Experience with CI/CD systems

   All of our positions are based in our office in Austin, TX. We offer competitive compensation (both cash and equity), an unlimited vacation policy, as well as fully paid medical benefits (health, dental, vision) for eligible employees. Best of all, we have the energy, agility, and fun of a startup.

   Help.com is an equal opportunity employer and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are unable to sponsor visas at this time, so all candidates must be legally authorized to work in the US.

   Addepar is the financial operating system that brings common sense and data-driven investing to our financial world. Addepar gives asset owners and advisors a clearer financial picture at every level, all in one place. It handles all types of assets denominated in any currency. With customizable reporting, financial advisors can visualize and communicate relevant information to anyone who needs it. Secure, scalable, and fast, Addepar is purpose-built to power the global financial system. Hundreds of single and multi-family offices, wealth advisors, large financial institutions, endowments, and foundations manage $750 billion of assets on the Addepar platform. Addepar has offices in Silicon Valley, New York, Chicago, and Salt Lake City.

   At its core, Addepar is a data company. We collect position, transaction and security information from over 100 custodial banks and market data providers. Bringing in and linking together all of these datasets is hard. It requires Addepar's Data Engineering team to build systems that are reliable and performant while still flexible enough to respond to rapidly changing business requirements. Examples of some of our challenging engineering problems include:

   - Growing our systems integration footprint from over 100 to over 1000 integration points in a scalable, maintainable design.
   - Building portfolio data systems that can scale up to millions of accounts and an ingestion pipeline that can process tens of millions of holdings and transactions every day.
   - Developing pricing and reference data systems that provide coverage for over a half trillion dollars in assets and linking them with positions on Addepar's platform.
   - Investing in coupled real time monitoring and analytics infrastructure to support mission and time critical processes.
   - Building out robust, flexible asset class support: we encounter public and private assets, funds, debt, equity, derivatives, real estate, art and more on the fly.
   - Building mechanisms to redistribute timely data to our client-facing and calculation systems at massive scale on AWS.

   As a Software Engineer on Addepar's Data Engineering team, you will be challenged to balance high urgency, mission critical development with quality software engineering practices. The goal is for every Software Engineer on the team to have a maximized impact on Addepar's growing businesses. At times this means taking a step back to rethink some of our problems at their core. At others it means brainstorming practical tradeoffs in order to meet a goal with immediate business impact. We invest deeply in our testing and tools infrastructure in order to decouple the scale of the problems we're solving from the size of the team we need to solve them. Data Engineering's core development language is Java. We also utilize Python and JavaScript frequently. But we're confident that as a great software engineer, if you're not familiar with those technologies, you'll pick them up once you get here. We also value the experience you bring to the table. If you've built complex, scalable systems in the
   past, we want you to apply the best patterns and concepts you can extract from your experience here. Help us keep raising our bar. More importantly, we're looking for driven engineers who balance technical depth with a desire to understand the big picture. And who care deeply about the success of the entire team.

   Engineering is at the core of Addepar and we are looking to add the best, brightest, and most passionate software engineers to our team. If you are excited about doing the best work of your career and you enjoy the rush of shipping high quality code to production every day we're excited to meet you! Our software engineers come from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to finance tech veterans. What they have in common is tremendous talent and dedication to architecting, implementing, and shipping high quality software.

Requirements

     * B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in Computer Science or related technical field.
     * 3+ years experience as a professional software engineer.
     * Extraordinary talent in software engineering. Ability to write high quality object oriented code.
     * Familiarity with SQL and relational databases, key-value stores and messaging/queuing frameworks.
     * A passion for implementing best practices and a bias toward smart automation.
     * Experience with the entire development lifecycle: inception to rollout to support.
     * Ability to collaborate with other engineers and mentor others in areas of expertise.
     * Excellent written and verbal communication skills.
     * A bias for thinking about problems objectively from multiple points of view.
     * Linux proficiency, basic shell scripting and a solid grasp of systems level programming is a plus.
     * Expertise in data storage systems, access and distribution mechanisms and ingestion pipelines is a plus.
     * Prior experience in or knowledge of financial data systems is a plus.
     * Knowledge of Java, Python and/or JavaScript are a plus.

   We believe the financial industry is fundamentally broken. Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but there are a dwindling number of people who say "I trust my bank to look out for me". It doesn't have to be this way, and it's our mission to fix this problem.

   We are based in San Francisco; founded by Max Levchin (founding CTO of PayPal), Jeff Kaditz (CDO DeNA/ngmoco), and Nathan Gettings (founding CTO of Palantir); and building a team of exceptionally talented people to join us on our mission.

   Architect, engineer, and drive the scalability of a complex modern codebase running across a fleet of servers. You'll design elegant solutions that are performant, well-tested, and fail gracefully even when they run at scale. Much of your code will be open source.

   The Nylas Cloud API powers a next-generation email platform, making it a breeze to integrate any app with email, contacts, and calendar. Under the hood, our simple APIs are powered by a large open source Python codebase that syncs data from providers like Gmail, Yahoo, Microsoft Exchange, and others. Thousands of developers depend on this platform for critical parts of their applications, so performance, reliability, uptime, and consistency are a must.

   You'll learn how to run zero-downtime migrations across a multi-terabyte MySQL cluster, how to test an inherently complex sync system, and how to instrument a live production application in realtime. We'll look to you to make decisions about systems design, architecture, network topology, and the best way to engineer the most effective system using our existing building blocks (AWS, Python, MySQL) and potentially new ones as well (Go? Kafka?).

   Your passion for writing well-structured code will let you take on projects like distributed search, structured metadata extraction, machine learning, and more-- all running at a scale not seen by nearly all startups. You will be responsible for keeping Nylas fast, reliable, and delightful to our customers. As part of this, you'll continue to improve our infrastructure monitoring and alerting systems, and maintain our system 24/7 by occasionally being on-call.

   We've got the fundamentals of our system in place, but our ambitions are large and so things are just getting started. In this role, you will tackle some of the most challenging problems in distributed computing, scaling cloud services, and designing service oriented architectures.

   Core technologies:
   * Python (gevent, flask, SQLalchemy, gunicorn)
   * AWS
   * MySQL
   * ELK stack
   * Kafka

Our ideal candidate:

     * Enjoys working on problems involving concurrency, distribution, optimization and scale
     * Is inquisitive by nature, and always looking to make improvements
     * Has a minimum of 3 years experience architecting and building scalable backend software systems
     * Brings an attitude of craftsmanship to their work, paired with practicality and rigor
     * Enjoys shipping code every day, and creating tools that focus on efficiency
     * Has solid experience in one or more of the following: scaling distributed systems, creating data pipelines, data processing/machine learning, test and infrastructure automation, building developer products (APIs/SDKs), database performance, search, metrics and monitoring
     * Has experience optimizing systems for security and performance
     * Is inquisitive by nature, and always looking to make improvements
     * Has deep familiarity with the Linux platform
     * Has expert-level proficiency with a modern programming language. Bonus points for experience scaling large systems with Python, MySQL, AWS, and libraries such as gevent and flask with a service-oriented backend architecture

Extras:

     * We strive to be a diverse team and we are active in several inclusive communities. Nylas is committed to making inclusivity a core part of who we are.
     * Work in our beautiful office, set in the heart of SF.
     * Our team is both fun and dynamic, ranging from quiet "heads-down" to outbursts of laughing, spontaneous pizza+movie nights, intense bughouse chess games, and epic hikes around the Bay Area
     * We're like a family, and eat lunch together every day. (And the food is good!)
     * Huge opportunities for growth and wearing multiple hats. (Your job will evolve!)

   About Nylas

   At Nylas, we're building the future of email--and enabling others to build on top of it. Our hosted sync platform and APIs enable developers to quickly integrate their apps with email, contacts, and calendar across all providers (including Exchange). The same infrastructure also powers our flagship email client, which allows open-source developers to build, fork and experiment with email however they like. The company was founded by MIT alums and is funded by top-tier investors, including Formation 8, SV Angel, and Fuel Capital.

Our front-end applications are working on Backbone JS and React JS along with JQuery. But if you think there's a better framework, you can always reason it out to the team. You'll also be the one interacting with the Back-End Engineers to set up integrations and design the storage and querying infrastructure. Setting up SDKs to interact with the backend over HTTP, and doing so in the most secure and object-oriented way, will be the crux of your implementations.

   The ideal Front-End Engineers are thinkers, innovators, and problem solvers. They care about scale, quality, structured readable code (preferably in MVC patterns), cross-platform and cross-browser issues, and module reusability, even before approaching the problem. They take ownership for their product, know their platform in and out, and are really good with quick turn-around times for feature requests and bug fixes. Taking feedback in the most positive way and redesigning key features to become more user-friendly is what differentiates the ideal Front-End Engineers.

   Technology Stack: JavaScript, Jquery, Backbone JS, React JS, HTML, CSS

IN MONTH 1, YOU WILL...

     * Month 1 for you will be a steep learning curve. You'll grasp the key concepts of the framework you are working on and will be expected to create a fully functional prototype by the end of the first week. Your thought process and understanding of what you are building will reflect in what you build. Once that is done, you'll be working across products and technology stack thereafter.
     * As you close in to the end of the month, you will realize how much the frameworks we are working on have to offer in terms of built-in functions and framework plugins. You'll start realizing the power of what you are building. Working closely with every product, you will take a deep dive into the business logics and how we transform layman feature requests into actual functionalities for the product.

IN MONTH 3, YOU WILL...

     * You are a key part of the team. You'll have a lot of dependencies, will learn from the other team members, and will start shipping production-level features and products. You are expected to be somewhere between intermediate to expert levels on your forte technology by this time.
     * You will explore and test out new technologies and also pass the knowledge to others. You will be the person that team members approach for certain specific issues across products. By now, you will have to get good at time management in terms of deliverable and side tasks.

IN MONTH 6 (AND BEYOND), YOU WILL...

     * You are an expert. You know everything about your product in and out.
     * You start growing your team, getting new hires on board, and mentoring them.
     * You become proficient at product planning and management, and start to gauge in advance what the next set of user requirements will be.
     * You start advocating your product and codebase every day and improve continuously.

WHY US?

     * Work with a team of Data Scientists, Engineers, Growth Marketers, Designers, and Entrepreneurs, all united by a common mission to drive the most important decisions that will affect humanity.
     * Our fail wall will be your claim to fame.
     * Our gadgets include: 1 XBOX, 1 Raspberry Pi, and a bunch of cool sensors.
     * Your day job might just end up lifting millions out of poverty or powering the next AIB episode on fire safety.

   No algorithm tells mayors the most optimized allocation of city budgets, no tool tell the ministry how to optimize medicine supply chains based on disease outbreak data, and no data set tells whether girl toilets in schools are functional or not. Our decision-making platform is used by over 150 organizations in 18 countries - by mayors to decide budget allocations, by philanthropic organizations to decide strategic investments, by governments to decide sanitation interventions, and by nonprofits to decide on disaster relief measures.
