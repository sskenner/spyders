That spirit of innovation led us to design and build cars that drive themselves, a human-powered helicopter, an operational airplane with flapping wings, and the fastest bicycle on earth. Kitty Hawk\u2019s R&D team is currently flight-testing a variety of aircraft with autopilots written in Haskell and code-generated to C.

We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them. For years, our team members have dedicated themselves to inventing world-changing technologies. We\u2019ve learned that to create something that the world has never seen, we have to set aside convention and re-imagine everything. That spirit of innovation led us to design and build cars that drive themselves, a human-powered helicopter, an operational airplane with flapping wings, and the fastest bicycle on earth. Kitty Hawk\u2019s R&D team is currently flight-testing a variety of aircraft with autopilots written in Haskell and code-generated to C. Our simulation environment, ground station, and optimization code are written in Haskell, and all components are either currently open source or will be released once they stabilize. We are looking for a software-engineering focused person with experience or",
