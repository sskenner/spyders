That spirit of innovation led us to design and build cars that drive themselves, a human-powered helicopter, an operational airplane with flapping wings, and the fastest bicycle on earth. Kitty Hawk\u2019s R&D team is currently flight-testing a variety of aircraft with autopilots written in Haskell and code-generated to C.

We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them. For years, our team members have dedicated themselves to inventing world-changing technologies. We\u2019ve learned that to create something that the world has never seen, we have to set aside convention and re-imagine everything. That spirit of innovation led us to design and build cars that drive themselves, a human-powered helicopter, an operational airplane with flapping wings, and the fastest bicycle on earth. Kitty Hawk\u2019s R&D team is currently flight-testing a variety of aircraft with autopilots written in Haskell and code-generated to C. Our simulation environment, ground station, and optimization code are written in Haskell, and all components are either currently open source or will be released once they stabilize. We are looking for a software-engineering focused person with experience or",

We need a diverse, core group of engineers to design, fabricate, and test next-generation medical robotics. We want embedded engineers with specialities, hybrid mechanical-software-electricals engineers, generalists and people we haven\u2019t thought of yet. The ideal candidates are people who get excited about building things, are highly analytical, and enjoy tackling new problems regularly. Our robotics integrate actuated devices with microelectromechanical systems as well as novel surgical procedures. These applications place strong emphasis on high-precision, high-repeatability mechanical motion, as well as high reliability and fail-safe design. Projects you might work on include writing the code that runs \"on head\" mediating between the physical bio-device interface and the high lev",
