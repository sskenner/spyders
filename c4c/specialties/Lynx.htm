Engagement data scientists spend at least 40% of their time deployed from farm fields to Wall Street working directly with customers to propose, design, rapidly prototype and build custom, enterprise-grade applications. We don’t just provide science-based tools, we are responsible end-to-end for improving our customers’ businesses. Engagement Data Scientists are supported by our core platform team and library of components to simulate, optimize and aggregate outcomes of all aspects of agriculture, but also know when to just “make it work.” As engineers we believe in types, tests, functional programming and automation. CiBO is a science-based company, so prepare to learn and invent with us!</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt">Qualifications</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Ability to think broadly and creatively about real world problems and technical and scientific solutions that produce value for customers</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Demonstrated ability to engage with customers to reveal pain points and explore potential solutions</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience in at least one of: clustering and classification; multivariate regression, prediction, and forecasting; or dimensionality reduction and feature engineeringExperience applying the scientific method to complex, multivariate unstructured problems to produce rigorously-defensible conclusions in prose and graphics</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience or interest in Bayesian methods of crafting generative probabilistic models; engineering informative priors; and solution via MCMC</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience engineering software systems that use: parallelization/distributed data, software best practices, significant performance optimizations, or a meta-pipeline to interpret other data science experiments</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience collecting, curating, structuring and retrieving large data sets in relational databases.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Basic background in computer science including the use of foundational data structures; programming and languages types; and essential discrete math and calculus.</span></div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 14pt">Bonus Qualifications (Not Required)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">We would be additionally excited that you have any of the following:</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience with NoSQL databases</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience or keen interest in functional programming {Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Erlang, OCaML/SML, Elm, F#}</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience with Bayesian non-parametrics (CRP, IBP, etc.)</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience with advanced MCMC techniques such as DREAM, Hamiltonian-MC, variational approximations, etc.</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience with either time-series or spatial statistics, especially Gaussian Processes</span></div><div><span style="font-size: 11pt">Experience creating complex data visualizations for multivariate dataExperience with AWS or other programmatic distributed computing environments such as MPI or LSF</span></div></p></div><div class="section page-centered last-section-apply"><a class="postings-btn template-btn-submit cerulean" href="https://jobs.lever.co/cibotechnologies/bffc2c29-f214-497b-bb69-3b61695f3df1/apply">Apply for this job</a></div></div>
