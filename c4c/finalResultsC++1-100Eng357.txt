We are also planning to provide realistic body capture using a variety a body tracking devices (e.g. mocap), avatar attachments, our own IK system, and important touches like realistic hair and accurate body collision hulls. The successful candidate will have experience working with avatar systems (e.g. in the game industry) and a solid understanding of the peripheral systems used in VR to capture body motion capture. High Fidelity offers a collaborative engineering-focused environment made up of close-knit teams working on complex and engaging technical issues.",
