We are building out tools, compilers, and diagnostics and want to add engineers to our team that have a variety of skills. This role will be responsible for validating hardware instruction sets and operating models, compiling and transforming neural networks onto the Mythic architecture, and developing tools and feedback mechanisms to improve neural network training and optimization. Compiler experience is a plus: while this role will not be responsible for building a full compiler for a high level language, it will leverage concepts and methodologies that are similar. However, our hardware and the challenges are unique enough that we will also consider those with strong core",
