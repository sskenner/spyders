We\u2019ve figured out how to use cloud software to lower the cost of traditional CNC laser cutter/engravers. And since we\u2019re doing the heavy lifting server-side, it\u2019s made it easier for us to create some amazing and still-top-secret features that make the laser more powerful and easier to use than any product on the market. Our founders come from hardware, software, and design backgrounds, and each one has turned products into multimillion-dollar businesses. Our space offers a full electronics lab, machine shop, and maker space, with 3D printers, scrapbook cutters, optical benches, and a 7-ton CNC vertical mill. If you like to make things, you\u2019re going to have a lot of fun here. We just raised $9 million from the team behind Makerbot (Foundry Group and True Ventures).
