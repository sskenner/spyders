The Studio Production Engineering team started in 2015 with a team of four, in building an experimental application for tracking production metadata. Several studio applications and many new team members later, we are now an entire department within Netflix, known as Studio Engineering.

A decade and a billion DVDs shipped later Netflix disrupted content delivery once again and began streaming video on demand. Today, Netflix has become the leading global internet TV service through innovations in content delivery, and we are poised for yet another disruption, this time in content creation. The Studio Production Engineering team started in 2015 with a team of four, in building an experimental application for tracking production metadata. Several studio applications and many new team members later, we are now an entire department within Netflix, known as Studio Engineering. Our team is charged with developing tools that will empower the cast and crew to create the best content they can. If an app is used on-set (production-facing) or by the studio itself (back-office), we are responsible for it.",
