You are up to speed with everything that is being worked on at the office, either through direct participation or via the demos on Friday.\n     * You have shipped many features by now and even taught the other engineers quite a few things during the Teach on Tuesday sessions. You've also learned quite a lot from everyone around you.\n     * Over the last 3 months, you've come into your own and have now become the go-to person to solve certain classes of problems at the office.
