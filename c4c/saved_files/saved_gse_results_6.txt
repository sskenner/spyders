We are looking for someone who can tear down an existing simulation, write in new functionality, and wrap it up in a package that others on the team can incorporate into their workflow without fuss. This requires someone equally comfortable setting up an adaptive solver for stiff systems, multidisciplinary first-principles modeling, creating variations on models to target different simulation bandwidths, and saving the sim from bloat by finding elegant mathematical/mechanical solutions. Even more important is having a great attitude by which the lives of coworkers are enriched.
