Our marketplace has an abundance of one-of-a-kind items from independent artists, designers and vintage collectors from around the world. Our challenge? Make it easier for buyers to find these remarkable goods and for creative entrepreneurs to run their businesses. Do you have the skills, passion and empathy to take on this task? Are you excited about building products that thrill our buyers and empower millions of small businesses?\n\n   About the Team\n   The technical staff at Etsy believes that code is craft, and that the work we do is part of a larger creative culture represented by the hundreds of thousands of inspired artists and designers who make Etsy such a unique marketplace. We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. We believe in measuring everything, taking advantage of our pioneering continuous deployment system to ship code early and often, and a blameless culture based on trust and a commitment to learning. We primarily write in PHP and JavaScript as well as in Go and Java. Our product engineering teams have recently shipped projects like a unified and redesigned set of seller tools, a better recommendation and personalization experience for buyers, and a system to allow buyers and sellers to communicate more effectively about variations on their orders. Learn more about our engineering philosophies, tools, and some of the challenges we've been solving on our Engineering blog:\n   http://codeascraft.com/\n\n   About the Role\n   You'll be helping us build delightful products and experiences for people buying and selling with Etsy. In the Senior Full-Stack Engineering role you will be contributing at all levels of our web application stack, ranging from back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL, Memcache) to front-end web interfaces (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The teams working on each feature are small, so there's a lot of meaningful collaboration between engineers, product managers, and designers.\n\n   We believe strongly in using both quantitative and qualitative methods to guide decisions. To that end, you'll be able to use our in-house analytics tools to gather information and gain insights. With a strong focus on creative entrepreneurs, you will work closely alongside our research team, go on studio visits, and discover insights in our forums. You'll also be able to use Etsy's Continuous Deployment architecture to push code to production early and often (and you'll probably push in your first week here).\n\n   About You\n   You're an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify. You believe in the connective power of Etsy's peer-to-peer marketplace and helping creative entrepreneurs scale their business to achieve their dreams.\n\n   About the Location\n   Our engineers are concentrated in our Brooklyn HQ and San Francisco offices, but are located all over the US. We believe that open communication and effective teamwork can happen regardless of where you sit, and we'll provide you with tools to make sure that happens. Your laptop will come with our video conferencing software pre-installed, so you can always join in on meetings and catch up face-to-face with your team regardless of where in the world you or they are.\n\nYou will be successful in this role if you:\n\n     * Can define and solve unconstrained problems, and know when to seek help when no progress is being made.\n     * Are comfortable collaborating closely with product managers and designers, providing estimates or product ideas that will influence your team's roadmap.\n     * Have a \"leave it better than you found it\" mentality, and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write.\n     * Love to experiment and use data to drive decision-making.\n     * Are generous with your time and experience, and can mentor other engineers.\n     * Will be a mindful, transparent, and communicative member of your team.\n\n   What's Next\n   Interested in joining the team? Send us a cover letter and your resume explaining why you'd be great for the job. We value individuality and variety, so make sure to tell us what you're all about.

These include the Continuous Integration (CI) system, various testing frameworks, and our user-facing deployment toolchain. Everyone in the Product and Engineering teams can deploy code into production, on their own. We do this over 30 times every day. Release management is a role in which everyone on the team plays an active part, starting on their first day of work.\n\n   Etsy is actively preparing to move our systems to a cloud provider, and the Test and Deployment Infrastructure team will play a key role in this work.

We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. We also believe in the right tool for the job, not language-as-religion; our current systems run PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, ElasticSearch, MySQL, and much more. We thrive on collaboration, and seek others who feel the same.\n\n   About the Role\n   Continuous Deployment at Etsy is a highly organized process which, without appropriate safeguards, could easily devolve into chaos; it is our job to engineer safety into this system. We build consistency, visibility, and confidence. We are all humans and make mistakes, so we actively monitor for failures, allowing the team to quickly right whatever went wrong. We are programmers and toolsmiths. Given the frequency at which engineers deploy code, we care deeply about simplicity, consistency, and speed in our build pipeline. We profile and tune the performance of tests, fixtures and the CI cluster.\n\n   Programming languages were interesting so you learned a new one whenever you had the chance. People were interesting so you learned to write software that connected people to each other. At some point you realized that mixing technology with people can produce unexpected outcomes.
