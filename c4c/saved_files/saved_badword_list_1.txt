You'll hit the ground running, working on products that integrate closely with our partners: A mix of huge public companies like Amazon, Groupon, and TripAdvisor, as well as exciting, rapidly-growing startups like Ibotta, Acorns, and more.  You'll work closely every day with the rest of our top-notch engineering and product teams.\n\nAS OUR FIRST SOFTWARE ENGINEER IN TEST YOU WILL:\n\n     * Design and manage both automated and manual test suites and test processes for Button's core products: Android and iOS mobile SDKs, cloud APIs, and our customer-facing dashboard.\n     * Execute test suites in support of new launches, partner activities, and baseline testing; and identify ways to share / outsource these responsibilities.\n     * Foster a tight feedback loop between product engineers and the test team. Consult during new product development to build and iterate on test plans from end-to-end.\n     * Build and share continuous reports on test acceptance and overall software quality.\n     * Build scripts, Slack plugins, Jenkins/TeamCity workflows, and other test automation code to scale up how we test.\n     * Act as the QA stakeholder on new product launches and partner activations. \"It doesn't ship until it's green.\"\n     * Working closely with our Product team, extrapolate insights from testing into actionable product improvements.\n\nWE LOOK FOR TEAMMATES WHO HAVE:\n\n     * 5+ years of dedicated experience as a lead test engineer or SDET. This is a senior role.\n     * Significant experience with mobile, frontend, and backend software products. You can speak from experience about how testing strategies differ on Android versus a backend API, for example. You have worked on a product of equal complexity.\n     * Great debugging skills and intuition.\n     * Excitement and experience coding in Python to solve grungy automation problems.\n     * Expert understanding of test management and automation tools such as TestRail.\n     * Excellent communication and technical writing skills. You take pride in the simplicity and clarity of the test cases and other documentation you write.\n     * Familiarity with Linux, SQL databases, performance tools, bash scripting, and git are all major plusses.\n\nHOW WE BUILD SOFTWARE TOGETHER:\n\n     * We have three major mobile SDKs: Android, iOS, and Web. This code gets in embedded in some enormous applications and sites, so it must be small, performant, and correct.\n     * Our backends are written in NodeJS, Go, and Python. We're a service-oriented architecture and make heavy use of many technologies from AWS.\n     * We love using chatbots to make rote tasks easier and more fun. We do all of our deploys through chatops.\n     * We're strong practitioners of pre-commit code review, unit testing, technical design docs, and blameless postmortems and retrospectives.\n\nWHO YOU'LL WORK WITH:\n\n     * James McGill (or Jimmy),  VP of Engineering. Hailing formerly from both Australia and Google, he spends his weekends hiking, surfing and designing and building furniture.  See James for all of your Vegemite needs.\n     * Siddhartha Dabral, Co-Founder and Head of Partner Engineering. Sid is one of Button's Co-Founders.  He leads partner integrations at Button by coordinating technical efforts between Button's engineering team & their counterparts at our top tier partners.  An engineer at his core, he loves to build & tinker.  He's also an avid sports fan, plays several musical instruments, and is the reigning ping pong champion at Button!\n     * Wyatt Harms, Senior Marketplace Operations Associate.  Button's Operations team building processes and collating partner data to help make Button the next big tech company. He's a big fan of summer nights on Button's rooftop and podcasts, among other things.\n     * Chuck Greb, Android Engineer. Chuck is an Android Artisan who loves building libraries and tools that increase developer and user happiness. Also a contributor and maintainer of open-source projects, conference speaker, and past organizer of Android Alliance/GDG Philly. Hobbies include hiking, camping, trail running, and traditional West African drumming.\n     * Wes Smith, Lead iOS Engineer. Wes is an early employee of Button and is also known as \"iO-Wes\". He leads iOS at Button and is responsible for building most of Button's iOS SDK and open source project DeepLink Kit. He's from Maine, surfs on lakes (what?!) and can often be found creating or consuming delicious things.\n\n   Our team values and celebrates our diverse backgrounds.
