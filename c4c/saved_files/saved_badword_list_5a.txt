Our mobile-first commuting technology powers the carpooling programs of many of the Bay Area's largest employers including Cisco, Tesla, Workday, and Salesforce.\n\n   About the Senior Software Engineer Role\n\n   We're looking for a smart and creative individual who (preferably) has solid experience working with node.js. You'll work with the infrastructure team to scope/design features and standardize best practices. In this role, you'll drive right into our backend stack, supporting efforts on our in-house matching algorithm, the scaling of our infrastructure, API support for new features, and everything in between.\n\n   If you're not shy and eager to rollup your sleeves on a growing team and in a fast-paced environment, this is a perfect opportunity for you.\n\nRecommended Experience\n\n     * node.js with Hapi (or other Javascript experience)\n     * PostgreSQL\n     * Python\n     * Git and Github\n     * Automated testing\n     * BA/BS in computer science/equivalent degree OR 2-4 years (or more) of experience working in an engineering development role\n     * Experience developing and working with REST APIs\n\nPreferred Experience\n\n     * MA/MS in computer science or equivalent degree\n     * Expertise with leveraging monitoring and logging systems & tooling\n     * Familiar with ETL pipelines and data analysis operations\n\nBenefits\n\n     * Competitive cash + equity compensation\n     * Vacation as needed (no cap on days)\n     * Healthcare coverage\n     * Free lunch 4 days a week\n     * Top of the line laptop, 4k monitor and accessories\n     * $1,500 a year toward educational conferences or events, plus a $200 education slush fund per employee\n     * 401(k)\n\n   SCOOP TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\n\n   Some easy math: what do you get when you take 30 Bay Area commuters, 3 cute office dogs, and the massive problem of solo-driving? You get Scoop; the company that's making it easy to carpool to work with your neighbors and co-workers. The Scoop app is the modern solution to the age-old problem of carpooling.\n\n   Our team mixes technology and elbow grease every day, with one statistic in our crosshairs: 80% of Americans drive alone to work. A big problem? Sure, but we know we can crack it through our talents, partnerships, and the Scoop Community that's already beginning to explode.\n\n   Our culture is bold and ambitious, but down-to-earth. We fill whiteboards with ideas and boring office spaces with energy. We're best defined by the moments we share: Friday show-and-tells, company baby showers, and eating way too much dim sum. We come from many backgrounds: successful start-ups, big tech companies like Google, and premier consulting firms. But whether we walked into Scoop with a tie or a t-shirt, we're all united by a dream to change the way people get to work.\n\n   At Scoop, putting the user first isn't one of our ideals - it's our actuality - lived out in the carpools we create every morning. Join the team, share our dream, and fight the traffic with a few new friends.
