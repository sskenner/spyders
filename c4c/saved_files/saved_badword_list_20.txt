As the volume of interactions on the BuildZoom platform increases, the system becomes more intelligent and better able to guide consumers towards the right decision.\n\n   By making this research publicly available, we are able to dramatically increase the number of people that visit BuildZoom to research construction and remodeling. We currently receive about 60,000 US visitors/day, and we hope to grow this exponentially by gathering and exposing extra data.\n\n   To accelerate the system's rate of learning, we're looking for an entrepreneur to systematize and scale existing processes and invent new ones that are aimed at gathering intelligence from the marketplace.\n\n   As an Entrepreneur in Residence, you will work directly with;our founders, a cross-disciplinary core management team, and Joe Lonsdale and Drew Oetting of 8VC; one of the top performing private funds currently managing ~$1.5 billion, to develop a strategic roadmap- complete with KPI's and your own P&L.\n\n   Specific objectives:\n\n   - Develop and scale an automated process to use building permits, which signify that construction work has taken place, to elicit and codify feedback on the contractor who was hired to do the work.\n   - Automatically identify industry-specific questions from consumers in the contracting purchase process, route them to the appropriate contracting professional in our network and implement a simple, elegant flow through which the professional can both answer the question and make a potential business contact.\n   - Use an existing clustering methodology that infers which contracting professionals have worked with one another, to elicit and codify B2B feedback.\n\n   The ideal candidate will be capable of straddling strategy and execution;

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Our investors have also backed Instagram, Oscar Health, Warby Parker, Harry's, and Spotify. We launched in May 2016, and people are already talking about our transformative potential.\n\n   We are seeking an experienced product manager to join our team in New York City.\n\nAbout you:\n\n     * You're passionate about building the future of healthcare: weaving technology and brand into a seamless experience for consumers, medical providers who partner with us, and the broader healthcare system.\n     * You're able to think strategically about Capsule's short & long-term objectives while relentlessly advocating for our users.\n     * You leverage data (both qualitative and quantitative) to inform your decisions and help others inform theirs. You know how to extract insights from data (SQL skills a strong plus) and synthesise user feedback into actions.\n     * You're a fast learner. This is a complex space and -- though you may have no prior healthcare experience -- you're excited to jump in, sweat the details, and become an expert wherever it'll help you get the job done.\n     * You work closely with stakeholders to ensure successful product roll-outs. You use lean prototyping techniques to validate hypotheses as fast as possible.\n     * You bring out the best in your team and help align people around common objectives.\n     * You have 4-6 years in a product management capacity. Engineering, design, or user research backgrounds a plus.\n\nAt Capsule, you will:\n\n     * Own a portfolio of products. In concert with engineering, operations, and growth, you'll create a collaborative, cross-functional development process for your product. You'll develop roadmaps, spec products that create value for customers & our ecosystem, and then build, test, launch & iterate those products.\n     * Own your own metrics.
