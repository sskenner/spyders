Endless aims to reach the next billion customers with new and innovative technology specifically designed for their needs and realities. We strive to improve digital literacy, education, and access to livelihood for users.\n\n   The core of Endless rests in solving internet connectivity. Whereas most solutions are focused on delivering more connectivity, we are building a platform that works with any internet connection. We have developed a full Linux based platform that serves as the pipes for content delivery. The platform is shipping into ministries of education and on millions of computers. With this, we open a distribution channel for content, payments, ecommerce, health, education, jobs, financial services and more to a market that McKinsey has called the largest opportunity in the history of capitalism. We are a business that understands the power of the coming wave of 3 billion more digital consumers. Build a life-changing product, and you'll have a market of endless potential.\n\n   Role: Chief Operating Officer\n   Location: San Francisco\n   Reports to: Chief Executive Officer\n\n   Endless is a network of companies with a core focus: use this platform to deliver multiple value propositions and to monetize those value propositions. This role is to manage the three functional roles of a core R&D platform, a consumer focused product and a ministry of education strategy.\n\n   You are a natural leader and manager of excellence with a track record of leading start-ups through the fire and a knack for bringing order to ambiguity. You value truth over harmony and approach problems with persistence. You are energized by challenges and give razor-sharp business advice supported by strong strategic thinking and considerable experience.\n\n   The Endless family of companies seeks to make an impact through the application of technology in emerging markets. We are looking for a COO to work alongside our CEO as a partner and primary leverage across a broad portfolio consisting of related entities. The COO will play a key role in strategy, operations, partnerships, organization building, and scaling the Endless Network. Primary functions will include:\n   -Serving as the COO for our core product company, Endless Inc.\n   -Tying together the interrelated entities in common alignment\n   -Managing a shared services team of operations, people and finance\n\n   We have a visionary CEO who is plotting an ambitious course for the company. Our CEO is very successful at opening doors, building partnerships, seeing opportunities, seeding ecosystems, making connections across technology and business platforms, and energizing our team. He needs a partner to bring execution, accountability, and leadership excellence to complement his skillset in order to create a company that will achieve our exciting vision. This role will have tremendous potential as Endless grows as a company and a network of related companies.\n\n   Endless just celebrated our 5 year anniversary. We're at a place where we need to find the right balance of ambiguity and structure; entrepreneurship and stability; and early and late stage company functioning.\n\n   The right candidate has successfully scaled a company and its team, and has experience partnering with a visionary CEO. You will keep company expectations high, and knit all of our teams together so we can fulfill our mission and have huge impact. As it is critical the COO remains connected to our end users, this position will require 20% travel overseas to various locations within our emerging market client base, with the possibility of more travel up front as the person ramps up to this role.\n\nPrimary Responsibilities\n\n     * Partner with our CEO to lead the company\n     * Drive accountability\n     * Ensure all team members have what they need to succeed (e.g., effective communications; clear goals)\n\nAreas of Ownership\n\n     * Own the business plan and manage day-to-day operations and budgets\n     * Drive company goals and efficiency through effective management of the leadership team\n     * Oversee company-wide processes and tools\n     * Coordinate across all global entities (currently US, Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, Taipei, China, UK)\n     * Contribute to business development and maintain connections to investment community\n     * Support and help foster a great culture at Endless\n\nDirect Reports\n\n     * Engineering -- development of our Platform product (e.g., Endless OS)\n     * Solutions Sales\n     * Finance (until CFO is in place)\n     * PeopleAdmin/facilitiesLegal\n\nRequired Experience\n\n     * Previous experience as a COO or CEO\n     * Software industry experience\n     * Highly innovation oriented\n     * International experience, especially in emerging markets\n     * Has successfully scaled a startup\n     * Proven success as a leader\n     * B2C experience\n     * Has built and deployed infrastructure*\n     * Financial experience to manage a company*\n       * Nice to have\n\nQualities in the Right Person\n\n     * Shared values and belief in our vision\n     * Values truth over harmony\n     * Results-oriented problem solver\n     * Targeted sense of urgency\n     * Comfort with ambiguity\n     * Humility and confidence\n     * Decisive, but a good listener\n     * Versatile, but a doer/builder\n     * Independent thinker\n     * Persistent\n     * Pragmatic\n     * Humble\n\n6-Month Objectives\n\n     * Earn CEO, leadership team, and employees' trust as a partner and company leader\n     * Sharpen company goals, including: roles, responsibility, and accountability clarity\n     * Ensure Endless Inc. is on a path toward product, market fit\n     * Improve internal-facing systems and processes (e.g., communications, budgeting, and decision-making)\n     * Build team alignment toward clear common goals\n\n   Please submit both a resume and a cover letter detailing what makes you uniquely qualified and connected to this role.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-11T01:16:47.645971", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Engagio - Success Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/engagio/75674510-cd20-43d8-8e4d-d9aa8a273ae1", "description": "   What we're Building\n\n   Over-Automation is killing the effectiveness of both Marketing and Sales.
