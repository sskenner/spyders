Our style is to push the latest open-source computing frameworks as hard as we can, and then go custom for the next 10x in scale and performance, by leveraging the unique attributes of our data. Every network contains a variety of devices, configured differently, on a unique topology - so every snapshot we collect reveals some new and interesting performance or scaling attribute.
