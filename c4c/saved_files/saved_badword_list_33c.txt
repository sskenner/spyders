As an example, we built Express Pay for Lyft drivers and transformed the gig economy in the process. Express Pay is a feature that radically accelerates the time it takes to receive payment from the platform. Instead of waiting for a weekly payout that takes several days to process, drivers can hit a button in the app and have the money appear in their accounts in 20 minutes.\n\n   Launched more than a year before the rest of the industry, our drivers love express pay. It has become the primary way that we pay our drivers and has changed the way that gig-workers everywhere think about pay.
