We're doing this because companies are increasingly looking to exchange data to either gain deep customer insights or leverage their data assets to create new profit opportunities. However, it's hard and costly to set up the legal agreements and technical platform to exchange data safely. Our trust platform manages the legal, commercial and technical risks of exchanging data to protect consumer privacy and ensure data security. By providing companies with a data exchange as a service platform we are opening up the ability to combine datasets in a scalable and economic way. We believe this will propel companies to move towards personalisation by offering their customers the most relevant products and services, at the right time. The possibilities for organisations are game-changing and we are excited to be creating the platform to drive this in a secure and well governed way.
