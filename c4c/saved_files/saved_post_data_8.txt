We're looking for web developers with 1-3 years of experience to join our engineering team of 6. You'll work to build features that drive revenue, grow our customer base, and create tools our internal teams didn't even know they needed.\n\n   We're a fast growing ecommerce company with a ton of fascinating operational complexity, and a unique, mission-driven take on the massive consumer packaged goods market. We pride ourselves on being a responsive, responsible, and effective engineering team that prides itself for building great products, and solving business problems with technology.\n\n   Here are a few representative things that engineers with similar levels of experience did in the last couple of months:\n\n   1. Worked with our UX designer and built a new customer-referral workflow, based on some ideas gleaned from similar companies, using Facebook messaging & sharing APIs.\n   2. Built support for multiple payment providers, then integrated PayPal, incrementally releasing to production, and quickly ramping to processing 20% of the company's total payment volume.\n   3. Designed and built an auto-responder for inbound text messages from customers, to point them to resources that might help them get their questions answered faster.\n   4. A promotion we're running got picked up by a coupon blog that figured out how to combine it with another promotion in a way that shouldn't be allowed. You dug into the code, figured out why the promotions were interacting the way they were, wrote test cases, and fixed the issue within 90 minutes of identifying the problem.\n   5. Dug into a couple of recurring Celery tasks that were proving flaky, did a day of research, learned about priority task queueing, released experiments to validate the proposed solution, documented the idea on our internal engineering discussion group, and rolled out the final production code.\n\n   You like solving real problems, and seeing your code live on the web. You know to think clearly about tradeoffs. You know to ask why and are the person who discovers that, when someone is asking for a shovel, maybe they really need a hole.\n\n   We primarily speak Python (with Django) and ES6 JavaScript. If you know that stuff already, great. If you know comparable languages and frameworks, that's fine too - the metaphors are all the same. And we believe you must have at least a passing familiarity with SQL.\n\n   We write tests, we contribute to open source (and create a lot of it - see github.com/groveco/), we practice continuous integration & deployment (a typical day sees 4-5 production deploys), and we focus on shipping working software with measurable outcomes. Our office doesn't have nerf guns, our snack selection is erratic, and we celebrate real revenue milestones, not fundraising goals. We do have 2 office dogs, and we're in a beautiful open office (with a 4:1 ratio of employees to conference rooms) just off Polk St in San Francisco.\n\n   Everyone who works here is nice, respects everyone else, works hard, and is good at their jobs. We've grew 4x in the past year, and plan on doing it again this year. It's a heck of a lot of fun, and we'd love to tell you more about it.\n\n   Let's do this\n\n   We're building a diverse and inclusive workplace where we learn from each other. We welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, abilities and perspectives. We are an equal opportunity employer and a fun place to work. Come join the community at Grove.
