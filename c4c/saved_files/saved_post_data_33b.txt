That means utilizing your experience with solid architecture & design principles to ensure the platform scales well as it grows.\n     * Building tools: Efficiency is the name of the game. Being efficient means creating tools and processes that our entire product team use to make everyone life easier without compromising quality. Sounds easy right?\n     * Collaborating: We've got a pretty killer team (maybe we're biased), and you'll get to collaborate and learn from all of them. That doesn't mean just all our engineering team, that means our Product Manager, Designers, Data Analysts, 3D Artists, and probably even our Live Production Team.

I just wrapped up a project where I architected a new feature from scratch. Everyone trusts me so much already!\"\n     * \"My team is crazy smart! I feel like I'm surrounded by a crew of VR geniuses.

It's pretty crazy there but I'm loving every second of it.\"\n     * \"Um, I'm part of a 3 person team to help grow the company in the best way possible. My weeks sometimes go from scheduling and screening engineers to just keeping the office clean and stocked\"\n     * \"I went to karaoke last night with my team and I definitely saw a couple of the founders of our company sing-scream Celine Dion songs...\"\n\nWhat you'll be doing:\n\n     * Screening: We get a fair amount of applications and are on a path to grow aggressively in the next couple of months to meet some hefty product goals. A big part of your job is understanding what we're looking for then parsing through profiles. Also realizing that a good hire is more than a bundle of buzzwords and real people are behind these resumes.\n     * Scheduling: Once we've marked someone with potential we've gotta chat with them. A recurring challenge is understanding hiring managers schedules, why they're busy, and how you can tell them to shut up and make time for an interview because it's important. The first two parts require empathy the last part just requires a bit of gusto. We'll let you decide if that part is necessary.\n     * Office Operations: We try to keep our office fully-stocked and filled with fun for everyone on our team.

This is something that will happen progressively over time, so having a mindset of constant improvement is integral.\n     * Random Crap: All those above tasks will be 95% of your time here, but that said- we're a startup. That means we all do a handful of things that aren't in our job description because that's what it takes to build something from nothing. So sometimes that means helping us decorate the office and other times that means doing bug testing with the dev team. Remember we're all in this together and at the end of the day, we just wanna build cool shit.\n\nHow you'll be doing it:\n\n     * With an aptitude for empathy and an above average EQ\n     * By getting real close and personal with Lever, our ATS of choice\n     * With an \"I'm jazzed about organization\" kind of attitude\n     * With a general interest and passion for innovation. Or dogs. Dogs are cool too.\n     * By understanding the general \"No Assholes\" policy\n     * With a creative flair and a love for Cher\n\nWhat we offer:\n\n     * $40,000 - $50,000 Salary\n     * All the fun insurance-y benefits you expect\n     * TONS of VR equipment to play with\n     * (semi) Regular Cocktail Thursdays\n     * Monthly sporting events & VR stipend\n     * Optional hugs\n\n   Note: Don't feel obligated to include a cover letter with your application as well. Answering our \"why you want to work with us\" question is more than enough. That said, if you have a bad ass cover letter, or just wanna say something witty feel free to include it!\n\n   LiveLike is an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

Founded by veteran biotechnology entrepreneur Rory Riggs, Locus has re-imagined economic activity in a holistic systems-based model called the Locus Model. The Locus Model provides a universal framework for systematically describing, mapping, and linking economic entities using function as the common basis for associations. The Locus Model transforms the way in which data analytics in business and economics is performed.\n   Locus has grown rapidly over the past few years, and we have used our proprietary system to construct a unique database that indexes global economic entities -- from companies, to workers, to industries -- according to our standardized definition of their function. Researchers and analysts have been central to this endeavor, transforming the way that we approach our work. Locus has developed applications in economic development, education, finance, and more. We hope to change the way the world describes, analyzes, and builds the economic systems that enable our lives.\n\n   About the Position\n   A major impetus for Locus' work is to address methodological shortcomings in economic thinking and to democratize access to economic analysis tools.  The Locus theory of labor and accompanying occupational classification system enable us to functionally map the composition and distribution of the global workforce and, in turn, understand more fully what people do, how they do it, and how their doing it contributes to their greater economic system. Understanding this drives practical solutions like matching individuals to the right job opportunities, distributing staff in an organization effectively, and identifying educational opportunities that offer the highest potential for workers. We believe that the study of labor can be transformed by using a functional information system to illuminate patterns, trends, and outliers.\n\n   Building on the the foundation of the Locus Model, we seek an individual  who is capable of managing the application and implementation of Locus tools to enable educators, employers, and workers to make data-driven decisions. This role provides a unique opportunity to strategically shape the trajectory of our organization by exploring and executing various applications. This is a role for visionaries who believe in the power of data to solve problems, bridge gaps, and meet needs that affect positive social or economic outcomes.\n\n   The role of Senior Labor Analyst will entail collaboration across teams, synthesizing abstract concepts underlying the platform, and building out products on this platform. Our teams work across many fields, including systems theory, machine learning, linguistics, education, community modeling, and data analytics, among others! Our interdisciplinary environment is complemented by a culture of lifelong learning.\n\nPrimary Responsibilities\n\n     * Working with project owners as well as directly with the CEO to define goals that align with the strategic objectives of the organization\n     * Developing and refining methods of organizing and analyzing global labor data to enable applications ranging from community analysis, to workforce development, to education\n     * Conducting research and analysis to strengthen Locus' economic model and associated occupational classification system\n     * Performing quantitative and qualitative research into potential application areas including, but not limited to, education, skills, training, and workforce development\n\nOther Responsibilities\n\n     * Driving business growth by developing pitches and proposals that will convey the value the work stakeholders\n     * Contributing to the design and development of software tools which will harness the power of the Locus database\n     * Communicating the vision of Locus and its applications to Labor to external partners and clients through\n\nRequired skills and experience\n\n     * Exceptional capacity for analytics and creative thinking\n     * Ability to synthesize and communicate complex concepts to various audiences\n     * Knowledge of and passion for data-driven problem-solving\n     * Demonstrated experience using statistical methods for data analysis\n     * Experience in project management and strategic planning\n     * Familiarity with labor economics, workforce development, job placement, or other relevant fields\n\nDesired skills and experience\n\n     * 3+ years experience working with clients or partners\n     * Enthusiasm for collaboration and capitalizing on intellectual diversity\n     * Experience in labor economics, workforce development, data analytics, job placement, or other relevant fields\n     * Ability to thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic, and flexible work environment\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-11T04:29:38.406915", "lat": 40.7127753, "lng": -74.0059728, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Logistimo - Site Reliability Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/logistimo/95818d7c-3209-41cb-b9a9-4a3aedfc9e54", "description": "   At Logistimo, our tribe works with a clear purpose - we leverage cutting edge technology to build web and mobile based products to improve the lives of people in rural areas.
