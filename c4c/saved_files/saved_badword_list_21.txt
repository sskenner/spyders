Your mission will be to iterate quickly on Casetext's full-stack.\n\n   We aren't looking for experience with a particular set of languages. Instead, you should be comfortable collaborating with other engineers on a diverse software architecture. We use cutting-edge technology, and are looking to push the boundaries of what you can do with JavaScript and CSS -- if this excites you, you're a good fit. Our front-end is a single-page AngularJS application written with Jade and Less.js that uses Firebase, a cutting-edge real-time datastore, to make the site incredibly fast and responsive. Our back-end stack includes ElasticSearch and NodeJS.\n\n   We value people who are excited to learn new things. You should be able (and excited) to learn new languages relatively quickly and improve the quality of your code as you go. Giving and receiving feedback is part of the team culture.\n\n   You will have opportunities to blog about your work, attend conferences, publish papers, and open source large parts of the code you work on at the company.\n\n   Learn more about Engineering at Casetext.\n\nAbout Casetext\n\n     * Casetext is a public legal research tool and online community that's quickly becoming the best place to discover and share legal knowledge. It responds to a major problem plaguing the legal industry and the public: the law is extraordinarily expensive to access and difficult to understand. Lawyers know that a handful of companies keep databases of legal documents behind steep paywalls, and thousands of hired \"legal editors\" add cursory context to help users understand the law. Despite the stranglehold they have on the market, these tools fail to tap the most valuable source of legal insights: the expertise in the legal community. This system is bad for lawyers, clients, and the public.\n     * At Casetext, we're taking a different approach. Instead of charging to access the law, we're making all of it free. And instead of hiring people to annotate our legal database, we have a growing community of practicing lawyers who share insights about the law to build their reputations and connect with colleagues and clients alike.\n     * On Casetext.com you can search millions of cases, statutes, and regulations on the free research platform, annotated by analysis from the legal community. Valuable commentary from law firm case alerts, legal blog posts, and other publications are searchable and linked to the relevant primary documents, so researchers find the insights they need when they need them. And it's all connected to an online legal community, giving authors a platform to demonstrate thought leadership to the roughly 250,000 people researching on Casetext each month. Casetext is the only place where lawyers and law professors post original insights, legal briefs, and even existing publications to peers in the legal community, while strengthening a public legal resource.\n\nWhy join Casetext?\n\n     * The work here will always be challenging and interesting. We are ambitious and taking on some extremely difficult engineering challenges that will be especially exciting to talented front-end engineers.\n     * We're a driven, collaborative team of attorneys, engineers, and designers working to make all the world's laws free and understandable. You'll join a small team of attorneys from Stanford and Yale law schools drawing on experience in biglaw, government, nonprofits, and law journals, along with a top-notch technical team from places like Google, IBM, and Zillow that's excited about what we're building together. Key to our success is that we genuinely like and respect each other.\n     * Now's the best time to join Casetext. We have just raised our Series A from some of the country's best investors, but we are still a small and growing team. You'll have the opportunity to take on a lot of responsibility, grow the first online legal community of its kind, have a major impact on the product, and take a substantial equity stake in a quickly growing company.\n     * The perks are awesome: health, dental, maternity/paternity, public transportation costs covered, $2,000 tech budget, we have lunch together every day, and all the snacks and coffee you can consume at the office in San Francisco.\n\n   Casetext actively pursues and hires a diverse workforce, and pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-10T23:25:11.721920", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Casetext - DevOps/Cloud Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/casetext/7c410f7d-4f8a-410c-8679-2fb94a7821e7", "description": "   At Casetext, our mission is to make the world's laws free and understandable through machine learning.

We're a social impact business, and we're aiming to build a world where no one is powerless and where creating change is a part of everyday life.\n\n   Our team spans 18 countries and are high impact, low ego and incredibly inspiring. Our users win campaigns for change almost once every hour. From strengthening hate crime legislation in South Africa; fighting corruption in Indonesia, Italy, and Brazil; ending the ban on gay Boy Scouts in the US; to fighting violence against women in India.\n   See examples of our impact: https://www.change.org/impact\n\n   We also do everything we can to look after our 120+ staff, unlimited vacation that actually gets used, and 18 weeks parental leave are just the beginning. The team themselves are high impact, low ego and incredibly inspiring.\n\n   About the Role:\n   We are seeking a cultural and operational leader highly skilled at bringing people together and creating a sense of connection between them. Based in Change.org's HQ in Potrero Hill, you will manage daily operations while being at the cultural heart of our largest office. You will play a lead role in shaping the culture and communications of the Change.org family across 18 countries.\n\n   There are 3 core parts of the role:\n\n1. Global community and communications. There are small Change.org teams in 18 countries, with a large team and HQ in SF. Your job is to build and maintain communication flows which support a positive and engaging sense of global community. We'd welcome creativity in how to do that best, and for now here's what it involves:\n\n     * Link up with key contacts from teams across the world to bring in news and content each week.\n     * Use that content to curate the production of a weekly video highlighting staff fun and major accomplishments Use that content to help plan and produce our weekly All Team global video conference.\n     * Produce quarterly ceremonies which recognize staff across the world who live our values.\n     * Global celebrations (eg International Women's Day)\n     * Your ideas!\n\n2. San Francisco Community management. Our HQ has teams as diverse as Engineering, Campaigning, Finance and our Executives.

Manage our SF office owning day to day operations. Managing a space housing 50+ people takes organization, forethought, and a smile. We are looking for someone who can foster a welcoming, productive, and safe space. Basically that means:\n\n     * Able to take ownership of situations as they may arise and deliver solutions\n     * Manage relationships and invoicing with key vendors (building management, contractors, suppliers, etc.), and manage them to implement new services and improvements for the office\n     * Be the first point of call to support staff's questions and needs, providing answers or directing them to the right people internally\n     * Support the onboarding of new employees\n     * Manage the office budget and establish standards and service levels\n     * Maintain a professional and high quality environment including greeting guests and visitors and ensuring a positive first impression\n     * Work collaboratively with other operational teams (HR, Finance, Legal etc)\n\nThis describes you:\n\n     * Cultural leadership: demonstrated success building or facilitating a great community of some kind. We are flexible in our interpretation of community, but we are looking for someone who has strong and creative ideas about how to build a sense of connection between people.\n     * Office management experience or similar (maybe managing events, or a background in retail or hospitality.\n     * Naturally approachable and people focused\n     * Solutions focus: you take ownership of problems, get things done, and keep stakeholders informed!\n     * Organized: you are be able to multitask but still keep track of priorities, managing your workload and other people's expectations accordingly. You have no problem managing basic budgets and expense reports.\n     * Tech savvy: we work on Macs, use Google Apps, Slack and have multiple video conferencing rooms. You need to be confident in a techy environment, and it will be a bonus if you can support others with IT issues.\n\n   Phew! Still reading and think this sounds exciting?\n   Then we'd love to see your resum\ufffd or CV.

And yet, paper claim tickets make up a $2B industry in the US alone.\n\n   At Chexology, we're replacing these problematic bits of paper with digital systems that provide benefits for all parties:\n   o Patrons can have peace of mind that they will get their items back in the same condition\n   o Attendants are able to check in and out faster, and the improved experience for patrons adds up to more tips\n   o Businesses benefit from valuable insights and new ways to connect to customers\n\n   Clients to note include Barclays Center, Webster Hall, American Express, the U.S. Open, and Nike.\n\n   We start by eliminating the claim ticket, then use that platform as a springboard to create new business. When we capture people coming and going, imagine how easy it would be to build a better foursquare. And when people trust their things with Chexology, we can enable peer-to-peer sharing rather than business-specific rentals.\n\n   Where we're at\n\n   The company has 2 primary goals.\n\n   The first is to grow the coat checking business that we've established by making it as easy as possible to get up and running. That means doubling down on reliability, improving client onboarding and training, and improvements that make the product faster. This is all in addition to all of the things you'd expect from a maturing product - what do we do with the data that we're now capturing, how can we provide more benefits to our clients - all while keeping support costs down, both in time and money; i.e., \"but will it scale?\"\n\n   The second goal is to eliminate the seasonality of our business by expanding into new markets. Organically we found clients that wanted to use our product for renting their items instead of storing others' things. This, as well as valet and bag checking, are opportunities that run all year round, drastically increasing profitability.\n\n   That's where you come in.\n\n   Who We're Looking For\n\n   We're looking for driven developers who already have a firm grasp on writing beautiful, well-architected, and tested code. This is so that we can instill more responsibility and accelerate your career growth. We love to see candidates that have a plan for the future, and know how Chexology can be a stepping-stone to that future. We want to be a part of that growth and will work with you to make that happen, ensuring your responsibilities are aligned, setting goals together, and regularly meeting 1-on-1 to make sure we're on track.\n\n   While your responsibilities will be focused on pushing the product forward, that's multi-faced between coding, hiring, understanding the needs from each side of the business, improving development and release processes, and [insert your experiences here].\n\n   An ideal candidate will come in ready to take ownership of a project and see it through to completion, from planning and ensuring that the requirements are well-defined, to development, through to a stable release and gathering feedback to iterate further.\n\n   The people who will stand out are constantly learning and improving themselves. They've not only seen the latest WWDC videos, but others too like AltConf, try! Swift, Cmd+U Conf, realm.io, etc. They've followed Apple's MVC pattern and experienced the headaches that follow, mitigating those issues with better architecture decisions. Additionally, automated testing is very important to us, especially when businesses rely on our app to operate.\n\n   Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:\n\n   o Work with Product Owners to define and develop products and features to help achieve our business goals\n   o Take ownership over production systems, releasing new code to them, and proactively managing them to ensure we're meeting our engineering goals\n   o Work with other roles within the business to help automate internal business processes to help achieve our business goals\n   o Work with other Developers to ensure the quality of work being produced is at the standard we have set as ourselves and will achieve our engineering goals\n   o Be actively involved in setting reasonable sprint goals and achieving those goals on a weekly basis\n   o Be part of the on call rotation to fix issues if systems you own are not performing to the standards we expect for ourselves and for our customers\n   o Participate in providing constructive feedback on all things related to you, your role, and any tasks you undertake so we can build a better, more enjoyable, more productive business\n   o Continuously push development velocity:\n   >> Hiring: Sourcing and interviewing candidates\n   >> Improve development processes (building, testing, and releasing)\n\n   Requirements\n\n   o Day-to-day familiarity coding in Swift\n   o Deep knowledge of cocoa and the iOS platform\n   o Confident writing asynchronous code and using promises to avoid callback hell\n   o Comfortable writing unit tests and testable code\n   o Significant experience with REST APIs\n   o Knowledge of architectures other than MVC\n   o Works efficiently on a development team (git flow, PR, collaboration / pairing, sprint planning)\n   o Comfortable with the process of releasing an iOS App (Signing, Profiles, etc.)\n   o Stay up-to-date with latest Swift and iOS developments\n\n   The ideal candidate will:\n\n   o Have used cocoapods\n   o Be comfortable with Functional Reactive Programming\n   o Follow TDD\n\n   o Be able to communicate effectively, both between engineers and with the company as a whole\n   o Be able to work well in a team comprised of web, mobile, and hardware engineers, designers, and sales\n   o Be a self-starter who is passionate, determined, hard-working, and eager to ship product\n   o Thrive in a high performing culture: continuous self-learner, stays ahead of the game, can wear multiple hats and be a team player\n\n   Start-up fit:\n\n   o A builder who grinds to turn dreams into reality through relentless determination, passion, epic highs, and a strong work ethic\n   o A continuous communicator, self learner, and change agent who can wear multiple hats while staying ahead of the game\n   o Able to work extremely well on a cross functional team\n\n   Worried that you don't fit this criteria? Don't be. Your growth trajectory means more than your current skillset, and knowing your weaknesses is the only way you can improve!

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition. Disabilities include, but are not limited to:\n     * Blindness\n     * Deafness\n     * Cancer\n     * Diabetes\n     * Epilepsy\n     * Autism\n     * Cerebral palsy\n     * HIV/AIDS\n     * Schizophrenia\n     * Muscular dystrophy\n     * Bipolar disorder\n     * Major depression\n     * Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n     * Missing limbs or partially missing limbs\n     * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n     * Obsessive compulsive disorder\n     * Impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair\n     * Intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation)\n\nReasonable Accommodation Notice\n\n   Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities. Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.\n\n   Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition. Disabilities include, but are not limited to:\n     * Blindness\n     * Deafness\n     * Cancer\n     * Diabetes\n     * Epilepsy\n     * Autism\n     * Cerebral palsy\n     * HIV/AIDS\n     * Schizophrenia\n     * Muscular dystrophy\n     * Bipolar disorder\n     * Major depression\n     * Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n     * Missing limbs or partially missing limbs\n     * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n     * Obsessive compulsive disorder\n     * Impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair\n     * Intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation)\n\nReasonable Accommodation Notice\n\n   Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities. Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.\n\n   Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. For more information about this form or the equal employment obligations of Federal contractors, visit the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.\n\n   PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number. This survey should take about 5 minutes to complete.\n   Disability status\n   [Select ..._______________________________________________]\n   Your name\n   ____________________\n   Today's date\n   ____________________\n\n   Note: Name and date are only required if you filled out Disability status.\n     ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n   (BUTTON) Submit application\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-10T23:34:10.681406", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full Time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full Time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "CircleUp", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/circleup", "description": "   Filter by:\n   City\n     * All\n     * San Francisco, CA\n\n   Team\n     * All\n     * Corp Dev\n     * Engineering\n     * Marketing\n\n   Commitment\n     * All\n     * Full Time\n     * Full-time\n\n   Corp Dev\n   Apply\n\nCredit Analyst\n\n   San Francisco, CACorp DevFull Time\n   Engineering\n   Apply\n\nData Engineer\n\n   San Francisco, CAEngineeringFull Time\n   Marketing\n   Apply\n\nCommunity Manager\n\n   San Francisco, CAMarketingFull Time\n   Apply\n\nContent Manager / Editor\n\n   San Francisco, CAMarketingFull-time\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-10T23:34:11.998660", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "doesnt_say", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": ""}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "CircleUp", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/circleup?by=location", "description": "   Filter by:\n   City\n     * All\n     * San Francisco, CA\n\n   Team\n     * All\n     * Corp Dev\n     * Engineering\n     * Marketing\n\n   Commitment\n     * All\n     * Full Time\n     * Full-time\n\n   San Francisco, CA\n   Apply\n\nCommunity Manager\n\n   San Francisco, CAMarketingFull Time\n   Apply\n\nContent Manager / Editor\n\n   San Francisco, CAMarketingFull-time\n   Apply\n\nCredit Analyst\n\n   San Francisco, CACorp DevFull Time\n   Apply\n\nData Engineer\n\n   San Francisco, CAEngineeringFull Time\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-10T23:34:24.101618", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "doesnt_say", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": ""}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "CircleUp -

Do you find that you want to choose other technologies but work for a vendor that limits the options that you can recommend? We are looking for a Data Expert to help us help our clients evaluate and implement big data and advanced analytics solutions in the Cloud.  At Clarity Insights, we only provide Data & Analytics expertise. It's all we've ever done and we love specializing in it and working on hard problems.\n\n   Clarity Insights is the largest independent professional services firm focused exclusively data analytics solutions.

We believe that nothing sells like great delivery, and are committed to our people and client delivery excellence.

We specialize in Data & Analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. It sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don't hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. We often could speak to a CFO or Head of Underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline - in terms they can understand - why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. If we step across to the DevOps lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about Apache committers, OSF, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. We're not trying to boil the ocean. We want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. We have a lot of fun\n   together. Most people join here and stay here for the people. That said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. I have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here's a suggestion - if you LOVE Cloud Computing for Big Data and/or Advanced Analytics, Machine Learning, etc we should talk.\n\n   Clarity Insights is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer.

AMD will act as a catalyst for development and investment in its targeted product lines by actively promoting cooperation and coordination amongst the value chain actors and ancillary service providers. AMD's implementation strategy is underpinned by a strictly commercial and market driven approach with a clear focus on strengthening market access for its partner organizations, and supporting international marketing and sales efforts.\n\n   AMD encourages investments in its four target product lines through offering matching grants and technical assistance, and empowering stakeholders by developing synergies, upgrading and streamlining supply chains, providing technical assistance to optimize profit margins, and increase participation of women entrepreneurs, thereby helping make Pakistani meat, high value and off season vegetables, mangoes and citrus more profitable and competitive.\n\n   Objective of the Technical Assistance\n   The objective of this assignment is to provide technical input to the AMD team to design and develop working models,  a 3 year program budget and implementation strategies with timelines which meet international norms and recommendations and to increase gender equity for the proposed interventions for setting upanE-Beam food irradiation facility. During the international consultants field work, the consultant will conduct a survey of stakeholders who indicated a willingness to participate in the AMD program and submitted letters of support with the aim to confirm their interest as participants. As part of the STTA assignment, the international consultant will set aside 3 work days to assist the AMD Grants team in finalizing the technical part of the RFAs.

BACKGROUND\n\n   LADA is a four-year, $19.3 million USAID-funded project that aims to improve the agricultural development and food security initiatives at the community- and national-level in Liberia. The LADA project aims to strengthen \"aggregation clusters\" through facilitating business relationships that link suppliers, producers, processors, buyers, and investors so that all actors along the value chain can benefit from sustainable growth. The goal of LADA is to increase the incomes of smallholder farmers through increased private sector investment in the Liberian agribusiness sector. To achieve this goal, CNFA will improve access to finance, quality inputs, mechanization, agricultural advice, and market linkages so that Liberian smallholder farmers can increase their production and participation in the market, using a value chain approach.\n\n   Risks are inevitably present with the use of pesticides and similar chemicals used for agricultural crop and livestock production and processing. In addition to required compliance, the PERSUAP provides project implementers with the most common risks likely to be encountered. It contains or references recommended mitigation measures and international best practices to reduce each risk. Beyond compliance, this document offers best practices and helps ensure that projects reduce the chances for errors and liability. Before errors (such as human poisonings) occur, it is the responsibility of USAID project implementers to put these mitigation recommendations into action. Implementers will then monitor changes in risks, impacts and mitigation success using EMMPs (Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plans).\n\n   LADA is currently working in five value chains: Rice, Cassava, Vegetable, Cocoa, and Aquaculture. The Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) did not cover cocoa and aquaculture and therefore, activities under these two new value chains cannot be undertaken until an amendment is made to the current IEE. The main objective of LADA's interventions in the cocoa value chain is to enable the production of reliable quantities of certified, high-quality cocoa for a range of uses, thereby ensuring sustainable livelihoods for more Liberian cocoa farmers and other value chain participants. To achieve this objective, LADA will catalyze private sector investment and commercial finance to the cocoa sub-sector and expand commercially sustainable linkages between agro-input dealers, smallholder farmer groups, and post-harvest enterprises through implementation of the following activities.\n\n   Activities under the aquaculture value chain will include access to improved breeding stock, fingerlings, locally produced fish feed, and best production practices (stock management and post-harvest handling practices) are major challenges hindering the ability of SHF to increase production to meet household consumption levels and market demand. To address these challenges, LADA will work with smallholder aquaculture farmers and other sector actors, including non-farm SMEs to increase access to finance for enterprise development, and will provide technical assistance to fish farmers and aggregators on topics such as local fish feed formulation, processing, and use; post-harvest handling; and business development services.\n\n   CNFA is required to prepare an Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan, based on the proposed activities and the findings in the Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE), and a Pesticide Evaluation Report and Safe Use and Action Plan (PERSUAP). The PERSUAP evaluates background and risks across the inputs sectors in Liberia, including treatment of seed, field crops, greenhouse crops, and livestock as well as processing. It promotes the use of preventive and curative Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and Good Agriculture Practices (GAPs).  It analyzes pesticide active ingredients registered for use in Liberia and recommends against use of pesticides containing active ingredients that are: Not EPA-registered, Restricted Use Pesticides (RUPs), Class I, Known Carcinogens, and Known Water Pollutants.\n\n   OBJECTIVES\n   The objective of this assignment is review and finalize LADA Pesticide Evaluation Report and Safe Use and Action Plan (PERSUAP), currently in draft. The goal of this PERSUAP is to bring the LADA activity into compliance with USAID's environmental regulations (22 CFR 216) on pesticide use. The PERSUAP finalized under this scope of work is expected to be applicable to other CNFA/ Liberia projects that may be involved with pesticide recommendations, distribution or sale.\n\n   The draft PERSUAP identifies available pesticides and their applicability to the current crop regimes in Liberia, as well as provides recommendations and information about their handling, use and disposal.\n\n   C.    PRINCIPAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n   A local or international consultant will be coupled with one or more local staff of LADA to support him/her in development and delivery of the following tasks:\n\n   Objective 1.
