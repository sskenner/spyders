To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Our team is a thoughtful bunch that cares about code quality, design thinking and having the right GIF for any occasion. We value transparency and believe in fostering an inclusive, collaborative, helpful team environment. We're always looking for ways to do better for our customers, the product, and for the team: #continuous-improvement.\n\n   We're looking for an engineering manager who is inspired to mentor, grow, and help teams succeed, especially when the team is still small and nimble. You're an experienced people manager and adept project manager who can guide developers to perform at 110% (without sacrificing sleep) and also remove any blockers that may appear.\n\n   As an engineering manager, you'll lead a team of product developers as they build new features for our core web app.  You'll keep the team engaged as we scale up; make sure that projects are running without a hitch; and bridge the gap with Product & Design to make sure that what we are building is on target and prioritizing customer value. As we onboard bigger customers and continue to evolve our hiring product, you'll guide your team to execute with efficiency, consistency, and, above all, empathy. That's the Lever way.\n\nWITHIN 1 MONTH, YOU'LL:\n\n     * Investigate, solve and release a bug fix to production. In order to do this you will ramp up on Lever's engineering stack by pair-programming with your teammates and attending engineering training sessions designed and presented by the team.\n     * Complete Lever's new-hire training week (a.k.a. Ramp Camp), and learn what it means to build a powerful recruiting platform.\n     * Introduce yourself and your management philosophy with a presentation to the engineering team.\n     * Meet with cross-functional peers around the company to learn how the organization functions.\n\nWITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL:\n\n     * Conduct weekly 1-1s with your direct reports. Mentor, coach, and train your reports on how to set quarterly goals, create plans to achieve them, and unblock any obstacles along the way.\n     * Run the weekly engineering all-hands team meeting in turn with our two other engineering managers. Set the agenda, encourage participation from the team, and ensure meeting runs efficiently.  Solicit regular feedback to iterate on the content and format. Deliver your first engineering project. Help the project team to coordinate their work; collaborate effectively with other functions; identify, communicate and reduce risk; run effective meetings and periodic project retrospectives.\n     * Update and improve the Engineering onboarding process and documentation.

Would you believe there are 1.4 billion customer service interactions of them every day? Every day. Some from maybe you.\n\n   Currently, it's far from it.\n   1. Customers dread it. Customers have to submit emails (or call and wait on the line before talking to an agent) and wait hours if not days to get a response from Customer Service.\n   2. Customer Care Agents work hard but it's a tough job with high attrition rates\n   3. Companies spend billions of dollars (over $140 billion a year) but are constantly looking for ways to significantly improve; When was the last time you looked forward to calling or emailing Customer Service?\n\n   We believe Customer Service should be real-time, automated, and delightful. And we have used the latest AI research to help build the future of Customer Service.\n\n   Imagine a world in which you self-service your questions as easily as a Google search and Solvvy enables every company to provide real-time solutions to their questions. Come join us if you want to build the product that is enabling it.\n\n   It's hard. It's a collection of some of the hardest problems in Computer Science. And it's fun for precisely those reasons. You get to work with a team of some of the brightest (and nicest) researchers in AI from top-tier universities like CMU and some of the most accomplished engineers from companies like LinkedIn. Every line of code you write and question you help answer is one more delightful moment for millions of people just like you.\n\n   Our culture is one of nice, happy, hard working, productive engineers and one where there isn't a single meeting for most days of the week. Brilliant engineers wearing Bose headsets (provided by us) building the future of Customer Service. Our interviewing process is designed to bring out your best, and we customize it to your strengths.\n\n   It's hard, and very few get through it, and that's on purpose as we firmly believe that small squads of brilliant engineers can do much more than large teams of hundreds of engineers. We've a big vision and big dreams but we don't believe that we need a big company to help achieve that vision. The founders coded the first few versions of the product single-handedly. Just two of them.\n\n   The Role\n\n   We are looking for experienced Engineers to scale up our Solvvy tech stack working in close collaboration with Machine Learning Researchers.\n\n   We've a multi-tenant service-oriented architecture that's entirely in the cloud and is fully automated. You get to work with AI researchers and convert the latest ideas in AI into working, scalable, secure, sublime implementation. If you feel AI is the future, and want to learn how to build AI systems, and have years of experience building systems at scale at some of the world's best companies, we would love to talk to you. Have strong opinions and experience making choices like Mongo, RDS, Elastic Search and making them better? We would love to talk to you.\n\n   Solvvy is an equal opportunity employer.

We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them.\n\n   For years, our team members have dedicated themselves to inventing world-changing technologies. We've learned that to create something that the world has never seen, we have to set aside convention and re-imagine everything. That spirit of innovation led us to design and build cars that drive themselves, a human-powered helicopter, an operational airplane with flapping wings, and the fastest bicycle on earth.\n\n   We want to give people time back through the magic of electric, quiet, and efficient flight, and free people from the tyranny of the roads and urban gridlock.\n\n   We are currently seeking software and robotics engineers to build proof of concept autonomy demonstrations and advance the state of the art.\n\n   We are a small team; we each chip in to do anything and everything to advance our mission as quickly as possible. Experience with all of the below is desired, but usually not found in one person.\n\nA partial list of things you will do includes:\n\n     * Integrate different sensors or transponders on our custom vehicles\n     * Write code to autonomously perform flight and traffic avoidance duties\n     * Write code to run on onboard CPUs (from device drivers up to higher level flight code)\n     * Develop higher-level autonomy algorithms\n     * Build a working prototype using a fleet of vehicles\n     * Ensure your code is well-tested and robust\n\nYou will be experienced with some of the following, and interested in learning others:\n\n     * BS (MS/PhD desired) in CS/EE/Robotics/Mechatronics/Controls or equivalent, with 3+ years of relevant experience\n     * C and C++, and some scripting language (Python, Go, etc).\n     * Robotics\n     * Integrating sensors and components onto vehicle platforms (cars, drones, etc.)\n     * Experience working with a variety of third party sensors (radar, camera, lidar, etc.)\n     * State estimation and sensor fusion\n     * Optimization and/or Vehicle Trajectory Planning\n     * Simulation of multi-agent physical systems\n     * Machine Learning / Deep Learning, Statistics, Linear Algebra\n     * Experience with, or passion for, aviation\n\n   What is most important is a proven track record and passion for learning.\n\n   We are located in Mountain View just a couple of hundred feet from Shoreline Lake and its surrounding walking/jogging trails. We offer a comprehensive benefits package including medical, dental, vision and life insurance (company pays 100% of employee premium), equity, unlimited time off, 10 company holidays, a 401(k) plan with 50% company matching (no vesting period), commuter assistance, and education assistance. And on top of all that, we also offer a variety of perks such as free catered lunches, flight lessons, snacks, drinks, fruits, employee referral bonus, IP bonus program, afternoon chocolate, happy hours and many more.\n\n   Kitty Hawk provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetics.
