Our Centers and Hatches are home to a diverse range of entrepreneurs, operators and investors who are building businesses, creating and expanding markets and developing new technologies that benefit millions of people across the globe.\n\n   To learn more, visit www.bcgdv.com\n\n   Introducing our Venture Build Team.\n\n   We have entered a decade of disruption of large corporate business models, driven by a step change in the power of technology and the audacity and speed of start-ups. To be fit for the future, visionary companies will deliberately re-imagine themselves by injecting or attacking established models with new ideas fuelled by technology.\n\n   Our Venture Build Team consists of world-class business leaders, product designers, engineers and technology experts. Together, we are helping corporations own the next horizon of innovation.\n\n   As a Senior Front End Engineer you will use your skills to:\n   Demonstrate and communicate a passion for implementing highly scalable and maintainable frontend services, and working with business specialists and visual designers to design optimal solutions\n   Build smooth and stable products\n   Collaborate with a team of engineers, designers and key individuals across BCG Digital Ventures to deliver empowering user experiences\n   Communicate ideas with cross-functional teams in an effective manner\n   Share technical solutions and product ideas through design review, pair programming, code review and technological discussions\n   Utilize a proactive and responsive approach to problem-solving\n   Apply experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the latest JS frameworks (e.g. ReactNative, React, Angular, Backbone etc.)\n   Develop and implement best practices in all areas of design and development\n\n   As a Senior Front End Engineer you will need:\n   Sustained experience in professional software development\n   Degree or equivalent experience, for example BS/MS degree in computer science, engineering or similar subject\n   Strong analytical and debugging skills\n   Strong knowledge of application and system architectures using design patterns, OOP and development best practices\n   Understanding of backend and mobile technologies\n   Provisioning and deployment in cloud environments\n   A preference for working with cross-disciplinary teams to introduce and enhance behaviour and test-driven approaches, resulting in clean, elegant code and application architectures\n   Experience of working with team members to encourage the writing of clean, elegant code using test-first approaches\n   A background working in teams using Agile approaches\n\n   Building great software at web scale requires a multidisciplinary approach to engineering. It is far more important to be able to reason intelligently about complex problems, and apply experience to new domains than it is to know specifics about the latest technology buzzword.\n\n   We do not expect engineers to be experts in all languages, but you should be able to write code in several core development languages, have worked with the important frameworks and tools in a variety of platforms, and be willing to use your knowledge and experience in new domains.\n\n   You should be conversant with some or all of the following, and know when (and when not) to use them. This is not a laundry list (and will obviously change over time), but a list of things that every engineer should either have in their kit bag, or know how to acquire:\n\n   Some examples of the platforms and tools that we use:\n\n   Languages / Frameworks\n   Web: HTML5, CSS3, Angular, Ember, React Native, React\n   Mobile: Swift (iOS), Java (Android)\n   Services: Java, C++, Go, Ruby/Rails, Python, Scala, JS\n\n   Technologies\n   Testing: RSpec, Selenium, Capybara, Appium, Calabash\n   Databases: Postgres, DB2, MySQL, Oracle, Cassandra, Couchbase, Mongo,\n   Infrastructure: Docker, Marathon, Kubernetes, Deis, Amazon Web Services,\n   Data: Big Data, Spark, Hadoop, Teradata\n\n   Tools\n   Git, GitHub, BitBucket, Jenkins, SonarQube, Bamboo, Jira, Trello, Pivotal Tracker\n\n   BCG Digital Ventures is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years.

We work in Python - it's a versatile tool.\n\n   We'd Expect You To Have\n\n   - Bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent experience/training\n   - At least 3 years of software development experience - many more is great, too!\n   - Excellent communication skills\n   - An enthusiasm for learning and solving problems\n   - A desire to invest in yourself and a team over time - we're in it for the long haul\n\n   Our Challenges\n\n   We have two, big challenges: collecting the right data from the web about brand and product content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers.\n\n   The first piece is a big, directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without (obviously) having the resources to crawl the entire web.  This involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\n\n   To filter the content we find for the customer, we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future.  We already do some image processing for logos and expect to expand that capability.\n\n   In some cases we are also detecting intentionally bad behavior, in a cat and mouse game to discover those bad (though intelligent) actors.\n\n   Our Stack\n\n   All of this data collection and filtering requires intelligent data storage, primarily in non-relational data stores within AWS, including DynamoDB, Redis, and our column-oriented data store on top of S3.  We use MySQL in RDS for core relational data.\n\n   All of our heavy lifting is done within AWS, leveraging Chef and EC2 Autoscaling groups to handle changing loads without human intervention.\n\n   We have hired engineers from a variety of different backgrounds and have found that sharp engineers can identify shared concepts and quickly adapt to the new stack, so don't worry if your background does not include some of these technologies.\n\n   To learn more about building at BrandVerity, please visit: https://www.brandverity.com/devblog\n\n   We Value Teamwork\n\n   You'll have the latitude to discover problems that need to be solved here and to shape your own role.  We're a very collaborative development team.\n\n   We communicate quite freely with sales, marketing, and account management as the company is small (under 40).

We work in Python - it's a versatile tool.\n\n   We'd Expect You To Have\n\n   - Bachelor's degree in computer science or equivalent experience/training\n   - At least 3 years of software development experience - many more is great, too!\n   - Excellent communication skills\n   - An enthusiasm for learning and solving problems\n   - A desire to invest in yourself and a team over time - we're in it for the long haul\n\n   Our Challenges\n\n   We have two, big challenges: collecting the right data from the web about brand and product content in context, and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers.\n\n   The first piece is a big, directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without (obviously) having the resources to crawl the entire web.  This involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.\n\n   To filter the content we find for the customer, we use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future.  We already do some image processing for logos and expect to expand that capability.\n\n   In some cases we are also detecting intentionally bad behavior, in a cat and mouse game to discover those bad (though intelligent) actors.\n\n   Our Stack\n\n   All of this data collection and filtering requires intelligent data storage, primarily in non-relational data stores within AWS, including DynamoDB, Redis, and our column-oriented data store on top of S3.  We use MySQL in RDS for core relational data.\n\n   All of our heavy lifting is done within AWS, leveraging Chef and EC2 Autoscaling groups to handle changing loads without human intervention.\n\n   We have hired engineers from a variety of different backgrounds and have found that sharp engineers can identify shared concepts and quickly adapt to the new stack, so don't worry if your background does not include some of these technologies.\n\n   To learn more about building at BrandVerity, please visit: https://www.brandverity.com/devblog\n\n   We Value Teamwork\n\n   You'll have the latitude to discover problems that need to be solved here and to shape your own role.  We're a very collaborative development team.\n\n   We communicate quite freely with sales, marketing, and account management as the company is small (under 40).  We use a lightweight product development process based on Scrum.  We engineer resilient systems so that we don't have to mess around with them all the time.\n\n   We want you to have time to do the things that are important to you outside of work and come to work refreshed and inspired with your best ideas.
