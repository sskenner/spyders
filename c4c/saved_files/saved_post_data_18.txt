Boom offers a chance to make aviation history.\n\n   ROLE OVERVIEW\n   The Head of Software Engineering reports to the CTO and works alongside the aerospace engineering team to provide software development support. Frequently this involves building web services to automate analysis work, connect multiple aerospace codes together, or organize data to make the engineering team more efficient.  In addition, this role will support the business organization in the form of \"sales-engineering\", such as route-planning tools & financial analysis automation.\n\n   At Boom, we take pride in a \"software eats airplanes\" vision of automation that can enable a very small team of talented engineers to do the work that would take 10x as many people in a large organization.\n\n   The Head of Software Engineering will take ownership of the software development function at Boom.  Initially, this engineer will bring their full-time programming talents to bear on supporting the aerospace & sales teams.  As the company grows, this engineer will build a team of software developers and deploy them across the organization.  Finally, we expect this role to own Software Quality at Boom--educating the team and instilling best-practices such as automated-testing and continuous integration.\n\nMUST HAVE\n\n     * Experienced, world-class software engineering talent--this person should have at least a decade of experience developing software across a wide range of domains.  They should have written production code in a half-dozen languages, and have worked on multiple systems across the whole lifecycle of software development--from startup-stage prototype projects to large-scale enterprise systems.\n     * CTO-equivalent, comfortable working in a startup--the ideal candidate for this role has been CTO of a startup company in the past, where they laid down the first lines of code and served as the chief software architect.  They should be completely comfortable being the sole-contributor on a number of projects at Boom, diving into existing codebases and developing new ones as needed--this person should enjoy the early-stage feel of a startup where many software technology decisions have yet to solidify.\n     * Technology enthusiast, with an insatiable curiosity for the bleeding-edge of software development--a candidate for this role should read hacker news religiously, and have found a couple of projects per-week that they spent serious time investigating.  They should have a github profile that demonstrates curiosity about the latest open-source projects, ideally having contributed meaningfully to a project.  They should have tried at least one bleeding-edge programming language, database, system, etc... and they should be able to describe its pros & cons.  They should love new technology, but also have an appropriate level of reservation about using something untested in a production environment.\n     * Experience with bringing early-stage software to maturity--this candidate must have seen at least one software system grow beyond the R&D stage, so they got to see the implications of their early design decisions.  Ideally, they have worked on multiple startup teams, as well as multiple stable production projects, and can compare and contrast these experiences.  They should be able to talk about the scars they have from making poor early decisions, the perils of rewriting vs. refactoring, modular vs service-oriented designs, etc.\n     * Experience leading agile software teams--while this role will initially be more of an individual contributor, this person will be working alongside aerospace & business teams that are run in an agile-like manner.  Furthermore, as the company grows and this person builds their a software organization, they must have experience managing a small software team--they should be completely comfortable with agile & scrum methodologies, velocity estimation, etc.\n     * Track record of personally writing software to solve hard problems--make no mistake, this role will be very hands-on for the foreseeable future.  This person will be ramping up rapidly on the aerospace domain, and immediately diving into aerodynamics tooling, avionics support, simulator, VR, etc.  They should have a track record of doing this at other companies, whether they be startups as the first engineering laying down code, or large companies where they did the first technical spike on a challenging new problem.\n     * Great communicator, mentor--as the software leader at Boom, this person is responsible for communicating the values of quality software across the company.  They should be able to demonstrate, through effective communication and high-EQ influence, the merits of source-control, automated testing, language standards, documentation, and code-review.  They should be able to mentor team members who are writing code but don't have deep software development experience.\n\nDEGREES AND CERTIFICATIONS\n\n     * An undergraduate degree is required\n\n   Want to build a faster future?
