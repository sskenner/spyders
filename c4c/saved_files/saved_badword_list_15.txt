Anduin is focused on holistically fixing all of the frustrating, costly issues that investors, lawyers and officers face trying to close financial deals-from bad actors to missed milestones to hard-to-track paperwork. We integrate every major aspect of the transaction workflow onto a smart automated platform, intuitively guiding all parties end-to-end from first handshake to final wiring of money. Every user's experience on the product is differentiated, tracked and customized according to their role and stake in the deal.\n\n   We built our workflow engine with interchangeable building blocks that can be reconfigured for any type of multi-party transaction. Starting with primary financing, we aim to build up a comprehensive data hub that can help drive transparency and trust across the finance industry-by sharing knowledge about standard legal terms?% and by making transactions faster, simpler and more repeatable. Our mission is to create pleasurable-to-use, viral systems that transform the private share ecosystem in a way that informs and protects entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors.\n\n   We're a Ho Chi Minh - based company with extensive connections among the wider community of VCs, law firms, and entrepreneurs. We also have cost-strategic investment in world-class talent at our Vietnam location - where we have a tight monopoly on the region's brightest repatriated U.S-educated (C.S.

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.\n\n   We're a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.\n\n   If you're an SRE who's looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you're not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you've enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You're probably also a good fit if you're a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.\n\nYou are a good fit if:\n\n     * You have extensive experience with AWS\n     * You are excited to work with Docker\n     * You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems\n     * You communicate well and work effectively with others\n     * You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility\n\nWhy work with us?\n\n     * Engineering First: Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It's founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.\n     * Independence & Trust: Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.\n     * Our Business Model: We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren't the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.\n     * Our Customers: We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It's a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.\n     * Introspection: Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We've lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.\n     * Professional Development: In building our deployment platform, you'll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you'll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.\n     * OSS: We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we're built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.\n     * Flexibility: We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you'll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You're always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.\n     * Upside: As an early employee, you'll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that's growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.\n\nOther Benefits\n\n     * Full medical, dental and vision coverage -- 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.\n     * Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, \"unlimited vacation\" means \"no vacation.\" We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don't do it.\n     * Fully distributed team -- you can work from wherever you want, or in a city where we have a location (Brooklyn, Denver, San Diego, Paris, Barcelona).\n     * Whatever computing setup you want.\n\n   ABOUT US\n\n   Aptible's mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.\n\n   Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages.

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.\n\n   We're a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.\n\n   If you're an SRE who's looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you're not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you've enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You're probably also a good fit if you're a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.\n\nYou are a good fit if:\n\n     * You have extensive experience with AWS\n     * You are excited to work with Docker\n     * You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems\n     * You communicate well and work effectively with others\n     * You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility\n\nWhy work with us?\n\n     * Engineering First: Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It's founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.\n     * Independence & Trust: Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.\n     * Our Business Model: We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren't the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.\n     * Our Customers: We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It's a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.\n     * Introspection: Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We've lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.\n     * Professional Development: In building our deployment platform, you'll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you'll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.\n     * OSS: We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we're built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.\n     * Flexibility: We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you'll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You're always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.\n     * Upside: As an early employee, you'll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that's growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.\n\nOther Benefits\n\n     * Full medical, dental and vision coverage -- 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.\n     * Mandatory minimum vacation each year.

Have you worked as a software engineer?\n\n   Aptible is hiring an expert in web security and software development to help make the Internet safe for sensitive data.\n\n   It's true: software is eating the world, powered by the Internet. A growing wave of developers all over the world are using web-scale technology to build and deploy health care, fintech, banking, payments, IoT, blockchain, machine learning, and other B2B applications.\n\n   Security and compliance are mandatory from day one for these teams of developers, but many of them struggle. When their teams are small, they can't afford to hire full-time for security or compliance. When they scale, they find that existing security and compliance management tools suck.\n\n   At Aptible, we make people-centered security products that help developer teams build security into their architecture and their organization's culture:\n\n   Enclave is a container orchestration platform built for developers that automates security best practices and controls needed for deploying and scaling Dockerized apps in regulated industries.\n\n   Gridiron is like the missing QuickBooks for security management. It helps developers design and run security management programs that meet and exceed requirements like HIPAA, SOC 2, and ISO 27001. Customers use it to build trust with their own customers and partners, and prepare for certifications.\n\n   This role involves working on both product and growth/marketing.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n     * Help design Gridiron security control schemas for integrations with AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and many other IaaS and SaaS providers that our customers use every day\n     * Develop clear, sane, easily understood policies and training content for customers\n     * Iterate and improve on the core risk API that powers all of Gridiron\n     * Work closely with designers and engineers to imagine and build new Gridiron features\n     * Help us spread awareness about security, DevOps, compliance in the software development community by designing and building security guides, courses, webinars, and tools\n     * Edit the Defense in Brief, our monthly newsletter on security and DevOps\n\nYou might be a good fit for this role if:\n\n     * You have a professional background related to software development\n     * You like to think and write about security on the Internet and in software development, especially practical security\n     * You have hands-on experience with at least one major information security framework (HIPAA, HITRUST, ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, etc.)\n     * You have excellent writing skills and a sense of humor\n\nYou might be a good fit for Aptible if:\n\n     * You think Internet security is important\n     * You prefer to work with a small group of high performers\n     * You are a deliberate communicator, and value good communication\n     * You're self-directed and comfortable with autonomy and responsibility\n     * You're ready to work remotely, communicating asynchronously across time zones and cultures\n     * You love learning, and want to grow professionally\n\nWhy you should work at Aptible:\n\n     * Making the Internet safe to trust with sensitive data is a good thing!\n     * It's also pretty fun!\n     * You will learn a lot about security, compliance, DevOps, and SaaS. We work very closely, collaborating across the company and teaching each other.\n     * You will get to work with customers doing really cool things\n     * You will feel invested in your work: We are highly internally transparent with business strategy, successes and failures, and management decisions. You will have a direct impact on success, and whether we achieve our goals.\n     * You will help us build a business for the long term, investing in a sustainable business model and building trust with our customers through transparency and visibility\n     * We are backed by excellent investors and have the resources we need to do a great job\n     * Everyone gets to live in the place that suits them best.
