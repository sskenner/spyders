We are looking for a leader who will design organizational systems that reflect our mission to improve people's' lives, and who will ensure our financial, administrative, personnel, and IT systems operate with excellence.\n\n   As the VP of Operations, on a team of inventors, you're one with the know-how, focus, and pragmatism required to turn grand ideas and theories into effective systems and results. You are thoughtful about process design down to the very last detail, and believe wholeheartedly in the connection between the seamless operation of day-to-day processes and our team's ability to achieve greater goals. You have the vision to see the short, medium, and long-term future of Future Laboratories, and can optimize and improve our organizational systems as we evolve. You intuitively understand how the various operational components you'll be tasked with implementing and improving -- from finance/accounting to legal/compliance to human resources and beyond -- come together to create a living breathing company - especially one that can grow and flourish.\n\n   There are several backgrounds that could serve you well in this role including previous stints as a Director of Operations at a larger institution, as COO of a small-or-midsize company, or as the back-office operator for a consultancy or creative agency. The most important factor is that you truly love operations and want to apply it to an ambitious mission that matters in the world.\n\nAs our VP of Operations, you will be accountable for...\n\n     * Streamlining and ensuring effective communication within teams and across the organization.\n     * Conducting effective organizational planning, including org and department-level budgeting.\n     * Cultivating and managing strong working relationships with legal, HR, and finance vendors.\n     * Working with our People team to iterate and optimize HR systems and trainings.\n     * Optimizing our office space, environment, and materials for superlative performance.\n     * Identifying necessary tools and systems to facilitate organized, high-quality performance.\n     * Other accountabilities that come up over the course of our work.\n\nWe're looking for someone who...\n\n     * Has experience implementing HR and operational systems for a department, organization, or company of at least 50 people, preferably in a creative context or industry.\n     * Has experience in multiple areas of operations including people and systems, information management, finance, budgeting, and project management.\n     * Has controlled an annual budget of at least $500K.\n     * Has built a multi-function operations team at least once, and looks forward to doing so again.\n     * Has a professional network that includes a variety of top-tier vendors and firms.\n\n   There are many backgrounds, industries, and life experiences that give rise to organizational architects and wise systems-thinkers who can build new things - and we're not attached to any one of them. Science, business, technology, engineering, journalism, art, design and many other domains may yield the right experiences for this role.\n\n   What To Expect\n\n   Once you're on our radar, we'll have a few conversations.
