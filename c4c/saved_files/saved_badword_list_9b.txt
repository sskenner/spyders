With computer vision and machine intelligence, we make it easy for anyone to program tasks in a matter of hours instead of weeks, while our platform enables developers to build the next generation of robotic applications. We're scrappy, we're focused, and we're out to change the face of robotics.\n\n   What You'll Be Doing\n\n   We're looking for a lead robotics engineer to transform complex robots into straightforward tools, so our customers never need to worry about kinematics and quaternions. You'll be building the architecture that translates real-world tasks into behaviors and motions that can be rapidly deployed and easily repurposed. You'll implement robust and flexible software at every level of the stack to enable our seamless, nay magical, user experience. You'll collaborate frequently with the computer vision and controls engineers to develop object detection, decision making, and motion planning algorithms that work reliably in the field.\n\nNuts & Bolts\n\n     * Own core ROS development\n     * Build behaviors and applications to autonomously complete common tasks\n     * Adapt cutting-edge algorithms into reliable and robust behavior\n     * Contribute to the robotic software platform and SDK\n\nMust-Haves\n\n     * BS in Computer Science, Robotics, or related field, or equivalent practical experience\n     * Deep understanding of ROS\n     * Direct experience developing software on robots\n     * Expertise in C/C++ and Python in a Linux environment\n\nEven Better\n\n     * MS or PhD in Computer Science, Robotics, or related field, or equivalent practical experience\n     * Experience deploying robotics software to customers\n     * Deep understanding of path planning algorithms\n     * Familiarity with embedded Linux\n     * Experience with computer vision, SLAM, 3D reconstruction\n\nPerks\n\n     * Competitive salary and benefits (health / vision / dental)\n     * Meaningful early-stage equity\n     * Extreme growth in an environment that demands the best work of your career\n     * Once-in-a-lifetime chance to improve the lives of millions of people\n\n   Pro-Tip\n\n   Send us your technical portfolio. Fancy titles at fancy companies are great, but we care way more about what you can build. It doesn't have to be polished, just help us understand who you are and what you can do.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-04T18:41:48.691217", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Carbon Robotics - Robotics Software Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/carbonrobotics/f1ddc530-5d56-4963-8f3f-9a1df14b7c61/apply", "description": "Submit your application\n\n     * Resume/CV\n       ATTACH RESUME/CV                     \n       Couldn't auto-read resume.\n       Analyzing resume...\n       Success!\n       File exceeds the maximum upload size of 100MB.
