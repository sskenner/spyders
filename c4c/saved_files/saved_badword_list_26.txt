We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. The Data Platform team is responsible for the platforms we use for batch and streaming data analysis, as well as collecting and processing log data from around the company. Our data platforms are built using open source software, and the team is also engaged in looking for ways to contribute back to the community through new projects, patches, writing, and speaking.\n\n   About the Role\n\n   Etsy is a data-driven company and the Data Platform team makes that possible. We are responsible for building and maintaining the systems that power things like A/B testing, Web analytics,  recommendations, and a variety of data-driven products. We are constantly working to scale up our systems to keep up with Etsy's growth, we are always looking for ways to add new capabilities to support an ever-widening set of data applications. We are part of the Data Engineering group, giving us a clear view of how these platforms support analytics and data science.\n\nAbout You\n\n     * You're a software engineer with a background in distributed systems like Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, or ElasticSearch.\n     * You understand the difference between a script that runs locally and a functioning production system, and you have the judgement to decide when it's worth the time to build the latter.\n     * You're excited about Etsy's marketplace and want to discover new ways to improve it through the use of data. We like candidates who are curious, enthusiastic, responsible, and generous.\n     * You understand that being an effective software engineer is as much about communicating with people as it is about writing code.\n     * You can write maintainable, idiomatic code in multiple languages, including one JVM-based language.\n     * You are capable of successfully building and evaluating a proof of concept using open source software.\n     * You have hands on experience working with data processing platforms like Hadoop, Kafka, Storm, and Spark.\n     * You can function as a developer evangelist, promoting and explaining our tools to other engineers from around the company.\n\n   What's Next\n   Interested in joining the team? Send us a cover letter and your resume explaining why you'd be great for the job. We value individuality and variety, so make sure to tell us what you're all about.

We do this by building libraries used by other engineers and building locally credible experiences on all platforms. The work we do directly impacts our international members. For example, we localized currencies and addresses, giving our international buyers confidence in their purchase. We also improved our search experience for international members. For many sellers, Etsy is their primary source of income, and we work hard to support them.\n\n   About the Job\n   This is a Senior Software Engineer position on Market Localization. You will be a major code contributor on the team, and will ensure that we are shipping high quality work and following best practices. You will also support and mentor the other engineers on the team.\n   This job involves coding in PHP and JavaScript, but you do not need to know these languages to apply.\n\n   About the Office\n   Etsy is based in Brooklyn, so the San Francisco office is smaller (around 40 people). Our office feels much more close-knit, and we all know each other -- something usually not possible at a mid-size company.\n\n   About You\n   You have a history of successfully leading work of significant complexity with deep impact on the business. Senior engineers at Etsy are expected to lift up the people around them -- you are able to support your team and create opportunities for them to grow. You contribute beyond the level of a single engineer by advocating for good engineering practices and mentoring other engineers on your team.\n\n   Typical Week\n   We work in 2-week sprints. Each sprint has a few goals broken out into tasks. We're a collaborative team, so usually multiple engineers are working towards one goal, each grabbing a task. Engineers also review each other's pull requests and help other engineers who come into our slack channel asking for help.\n\nFirst Month - You will spend the first month getting familiar with the company and the team. You will:\n\n     * Become familiar with our tools\n     * Learn about our practices, such as Continuous Deployment and choosing boring technology\n     * Meet people, have 1-on-1s with both new engineers and senior engineers\n     * Ship code to production\n\nFirst Six Months - You will spend the first six months diving deep into Market Localization's work. You will:\n\n     * Build and launch many features experimentally using our A/B test framework\n     * Iterate quickly using a fast gather data, build a hypothesis, test the hypothesis loop\n     * Grow your knowledge about our architecture\n     * Understand our members better by meeting our sellers and responding to a customer support email\n\nFirst Year - Here's what you can expect to have accomplished in the first year:\n\n     * You were able to teach what you've learned to others\n     * You shipped features that make a lasting difference for our buyers and sellers, and suggested improvements for the future.\n     * You drove projects to completion and led projects with your teammates\n\nMust haves\n\n     * Our team values working well with other people. You will work with engineers, product managers, project managers, and designers, all with different needs. You must be able to understand everyone's needs and work with the group to build the product.\n     * Market Localization has a wide domain, so you must be able to learn new technology. You might be in our big data stack one day, and in our iOS codebase the next day.\n     * On the technology side:\n     * Proficient in one scripting language\n     * Experience working with a relational database like MySQL\n     * Can organize your own work, and the work of others\n     * Able to clearly explain tradeoffs in your work\n     * Well-versed in testing\n     * Full-stack experience\n\nNice to haves\n\n     * Experience with A/B testing\n     * International / localization experience\n     * Deep full-stack knowledge\n\n   What's Next\n   Interested in joining the team?

We take thorny, technically challenging processes, and turn them into delightful experiences by combining intuitive design with extremely modern and secure engineering practices.\n\n   If you're excited about helping us continue to build an incredible product that we're proud of and that our customers love, you'll be a great fit.\n\n   Who you are\n   o You have at least 2+ years of experience as a Product Manager, or similar role.\n   o You have either a degree in Computer Science or equivalent on-the-job engineering experience. This gives you the knowledge to speak comfortably and confidentially about nitty gritty technical details, such as thinking through what changes will be required by the API layer in order to build a new feature. Specifically, you have theoretical understanding of most technologies you'll encounter when building product at Fleetsmith. A sampling of those are:\n\n   o web concepts like: HTML, Javascript, CSS, cookies, sessions, JWTs\n   o various command line *nix tools\n   o HTTPS/TLS/PKI\n   o RESTful APIs\n\n   o You're passionate about helping build a product--and being part of a company--that people love.\n   o You know that great products are those that solve real world problems that human beings experience every day in their jobs, and that the only way to do that is through deep empathy with the customer.\n   o Your curiosity is insatiable and you're always learning. Once you've decided to explore something, you can't help but dig deep to gain deep understanding.\n   o You're equally comfortable talking shop with engineers and designers.\n   o You understand that working cross functionally with other groups such as Engineering, Design, and Marketing requires incredible communication skills and a huge dose of empathy.\n   o You sweat the details. You notice when things are just slightly off and you hold others to high standards as well. To prove it, you'll add a\":)\" in front of your name when you submit your r\ufffdsum\ufffd.\n   o When you encounter a difficult challenge, it makes you want to redouble your efforts until the problem at hand is solved.\n   o You understand how to have difficult conversations around tradeoffs when faced with real world resource constraints, and make the best decision possible.\n   o You know that at the end of the day, the single most important aspect of product management is getting features out door.\n\n   What your days will look like\n   o Maintain weekly project status in a fast paced, startup environment.\n   o Work with project owner and stakeholders to complete scoping, goals, deliverables, required resources, and timing.\n   o Gain insights on how to improve the product via both formalized qualitative analysis (e.g. via user research) and quantitative analysis (e.g. using our product analytics tooling) to inform important product decisions and roadmap. In other words, formulate hypothesis and utilize the scientific method to ask and answer questions using data.\n   o Perform in-depth technical background research. Often this requires reading lots of documentation and extensive Googling. You'll frequently encounter situations where this level of research is required to understand whether it's possible to build a given product objective/feature using official platform APIs in macOS, or if custom work will be required of the Engineering team.\n   o Maintain our high product quality bar via both extensive daily use of Fleetsmith and by owning functional QA testing before allowing new features and bug fixes to ship.\n   o Interact with users to understand their needs, and help represent user mindset and desire internally to stakeholders.\n   o Write acceptance criteria and requirements, and manage project execution.\n   o Run daily stand-ups (familiarity with scrum and JIRA are required).\n\n   Who you'll be working with\n   You'll work closely with (and report to) the Chief Product Officer, and will work closely with Product and Engineering teams to help us move forward, recognize obstacles quicker and hit milestones.\n\n   Who we are\n   Fleetsmith is the only cloud-based Mac management product that puts security first and integrates with G Suite. Fleetsmith's innovative technology empowers anyone in charge of company Macs to easily deploy, manage, and secure them over the internet.
