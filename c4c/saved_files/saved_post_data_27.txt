People who are willing to pursue what some say is impossible, to push past the point where others would quit, and to dream at the scale of society itself.

As the head of our invention work, you will play arguably the single most formative role in ensuring that the things we build take shape correctly, and actually yield tangible impact in the world. And yet despite all this, you know invention is ultimately a function of being fully alive. You are a kind of Willa Wonka or Walt Disney for society.\n\n   But you aren't just a master dreamer and tinkerer. You're also a leader, a strategic coach, a builder and nudger of teams, coaxing and supporting them throughout the difficult-but-rewarding work of invention. You are more concerned with the successes of these teams than with the deepening of your own prowess - partly because that is your nature, but also because you understand that in order to deliver on our promise to the world - to truly meet our mission - we need to reliably crack the nut of invention itself. We need to build an engine that can take curiosities and questions, data and insights, and turn them into new things of all shapes and sizes - new companies, new products, new concepts, new public policies, new art - anything you can imagine. And we need a plan for how to take a breakthrough concept - once surfaced - and support it through its initial explorations and prototypes, getting it to the point where it has a heartbeat.\n\n   When it comes to mastering the process of invention - let alone our process of invention - we have far more questions than answers. But that's appropriate, and you know that. This will not be easy work. But we know that doesn't deter you; it excites you. What else do we know about you?\n\n   You've made many types of things, in many contexts, with a wide range of outcomes. You understand that everything is related, and so when you build, your creations have that in mind. You've seen firsthand a hundred different ways that smart teams can fail to make a thing that works - and the small handful of ways they tend to get it right. And - despite all of that experience - you know that it's important to give teams nudges, not shoves, to keep them on track.\n\n   You have a sense that all of your experiences making things in the world - and seeing things being made - have been preparing you for something grand. And you feel like if someone just gave you the time, space, and resources to build the things that need to be built - you'd dive into that for a decade without a second thought.\n\n   Well, here's your chance.\n\nAs our SVP Invention, you will be accountable for...\n\n     * Architecting and building the Invention team that will bring new projects to life, including which functions we build in-house vs. via partners, what backgrounds the team must have, and other key decisions.\n     * Designing and iterating the ways that the Invention team does its work. This means figuring out what methods and processes we use or don't use, how we select, resource, and advance projects, and how we design our work environment for innovation to happen in a reliable way.\n     * Partnering with the SVP People & Systems to build the best team-building apparatus the world has ever seen, to make sure that each project has the right people working on it.\n     * Partnering with the SVP Insights and their team, to make sure that we're using research, data, and analysis to guide what we make and how we make.\n     * Partnering with the SVP Revenue and their team, to make sure that our invention processes are informed by our customers and partners - not just our own research.\n     * Partnering with the VP Marketing & Partnerships - and the rest of the executive team - to continually position Future Laboratories' brand as an invitation for people to be inventors in their own right.\n\nWe're looking for someone who...\n\n     * Has a deep background in at least one entrepreneurial methodology related to startups, software development, media, engineering, technical invention, or industrial design - and ideally is well-versed in several of these disciplines.\n     * Deeply enjoys the art of team leadership, and is excited to invest energy in being an organizational shaper in terms of methodology, culture, outcomes - everything!\n     * Has been on, witnessed, and built teams that made things that mattered,\n     * Understands the relationship between a core brand promise and the meticulous work of creating an organizational identity through rigor and focus.\n     * Has a fantastically diverse network of smart people at all levels of seniority, across industries and organizations, to draw on for advice, feedback, and ideas.\n     * Has an unmistakable intuition about how things should be planned, sequenced, prototyped, and built, based on a lot of experience.\n     * Has a tendency to accumulate useful mental models from far-flung corners of human domains, and has an uncanny ability to pull the right one at the right time to guide decision-making in a given setting.\n     * Believes that creative genius lives inside all of us, and that it's just a little closer to the top in some people - and treats team members accordingly, i.e. can coach people to uncovering their talents.\n     * Has held budget accountability for millions of dollars worth of engineering, product, R&D, or capital investments - or similar responsibilities.\n\n   There are many backgrounds, industries, and life experiences that give rise to organizational architects and wise systems-thinkers who can build new things - and we're not attached to any one of them.
