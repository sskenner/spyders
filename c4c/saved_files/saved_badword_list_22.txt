We are focused on building software that brings additional value to Cratejoy by delivering high quality, incremental solutions regularly. As a Software Engineer, you will be responsible for working with the product team, building tools on our platform to provide a world-class user experience, make it highly scalable and extremely reliable.\n\n   We are passionate about our product and that means thinking holistically about the experience we are providing for our users.  We've got a strong product team to help support this, but we expect engineers to be unafraid of jumping on hard problems, doing the dirty work, making sense of them, and helping craft the solution, not just the implementation.\n\n   We are looking for people to be good at their job and help elevate the team around them.  We care deeply about career growth and we want people that will also help grow us.\n\n   This is that dream role at a start-up you've been looking for - all the passion and growth, lots of up-side but without having to eat ramen 3 meals a day. This isn't a photo sharing app - people are quitting their jobs and realizing their dreams on Cratejoy. It's real, it really matters - and it's unbelievably fulfilling.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n     * Build new, industry-leading user experiences\n     * Integrate merchant facing functionality into our platform\n     * Work with the design team to optimize user interaction\n     * Monitor and improve the system's overall performance\n     * Be passionate about our users and the quality of our software\n\nSkills & Abilities\n\n     * 2+ years of professional software engineering experience\n     * Experience with modern HTML/CSS, React.js\n     * Experience with Python (experience with Flask is a plus)\n     * Excellent at cross-functional communication (engineering, product, design, marketing, etc)\n\nCompensation\n\n     * $80k-$105k depending on experience\n     * All offers include equity, health care, 401k, downtown parking, free lunches, and lots more :)\n\n   Who we want to work with\n\n   We want to work with people who want to work at Cratejoy, not just people who are looking for their next job. They specifically have sought out Cratejoy, they understand what our company does and they feel some sort of affinity with the mission. They are hungry for knowledge and are looking to be challenged in new ways, perhaps they even aspire to start their own business one day - or maybe they already have and now they want to know how to start a high impact business next time. They obviously care about compensation but they aren't just looking for the next higher title and a little pay bump from their current job. They are leaving their current company after making some sort of impact, rather than because they just seem to leave jobs every 18 months once they realize it wasn't as exciting as they thought it would be.\n\n   They seem to be aware of who they are as a person, including their own weaknesses, and want the sort of direct feedback and coaching it takes to grow their skillset, into a better team member, and even into a better person. In general people they worked with in the past would say that they are the type of person that \"seems to make everything a little bit better\" and that adding them to any conversation made the conversation more interesting, rather than more frustrating.\n\n   They respect their peers and want to learn more from those around them, and they give people the benefit of the doubt. They don't rush to condemn people and they don't quietly judge, they seek to help their peers be their best. They don't like to assign blame, but if they were to assign blame they'd be just as likely to assign it to themselves as anyone else.\n\n   They are hard working when they have a mission, but they aren't just aimlessly working tons of hours for no particular reason. They care a lot about what it is that they are doing, and they don't just blindly follow direction. They want and need to understand how their work connects with the mission of the company and once they do they take it on as their own mission in life. When looking to solve problems they are willing to go outside themselves, but only after doing the diligence necessary. They don't like to waste anyone's time - least of all their own.\n   They are quick to admit mistakes, and they don't let ego leave them on the wrong side of an issue for very long (or very often). In their area of primary skillset they are very strong in it. They may have other weaknesses, which is okay as long as they are aware of them, but there is at least one or two things at which they are indisputably A+.\n\n   About Cratejoy\n\n   Cratejoy is the one-stop destination for all things subscription box. Where you subscribe to what you love, and sell what you're passionate about.\n\n   We're a Y Combinator and Capital Factory company and have raised a series A from CRV in California. We're very well funded and have been growing at a staggering rate every single month since launch. Cratejoy's growth is rocket ship fast, and we'd love for you to be a big part of it.\n\n   Our aim is to make subscription as accessible as eBay or Etsy make ecommerce today. Our vision is to bring the best business model in the universe to everyone on the planet.\n\n   There's 3 pieces to that vision:\n\n   The first was our subscription commerce platform. Our seller tools. There was no consensus for how to run a subscription business. We had to design those tools and build them. We had to do it in a way that is accessible to average online merchant. If they were savvy enough to run an etsy store they should be more than savvy enough to run a cratejoy subscription.\n\n   The next piece was education. There really were no resources that taught merchants how to run a subscription business. We built subscription school which is a free education site we run. Our team has deep subscription commerce expertise. We write articles, post videos and host webinars to teach people how to run subscription businesses. We created a forum which puts merchants in an community where they support each other and learn together. In the space of a year we've become the unrivaled thought leaders inside of subscription commerce.\n\n   Finally, we've built the marketplace. This is a consumer destination site that sells subscriptions. Consumers arrive at Cratejoy and subscribe to our merchants. We cross-sell additional subscriptions to them. This is the piece that we wanted to get to. By creating the platform we were aggregating supply for the marketplace. The marketplace is the demand side of the equation. And the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts, these all tie back together to build the virtuous cycle that is the Cratejoy ecosystem.\n\n   FAQ\n\n   How much have you raised? $11M in VC from the best investors in the world\n\n   Do you have revenue? Many millions of dollars, yes.\n\n   How big is the team? 45 people\n\n   Where is the office? Downtown at the corner of 8th and Brazos in beautiful Austin, TX\n\n   Is there 100% paid medical/dental/life insurance? Yep!\n\n   How about equity in a venture backed fast growing pre-IPO startup?

We believe in making product decisions based on data--both qualitative and quantitative. If you love identifying problems, sizing opportunities, optimizing funnels, and take pride in work that is clean & delightful, then you would love to work with us.\n\n   Your Role\n   You will report to the CEO/co-founder, who will be your advisor--but not your product manager. You will collaborate with your coworkers and reach out to users to set your product priorities. As the lead researcher, data-gatherer, wireframe-maker, and question asker, you will be expected to exercise your judgment and intelligence to determine both why and how we build products. You will share your work early and often, gather feedback from all sources (including engineering leads), and ultimately make the right choice for our users, without compromise. During the final stage of product design, you will add polish and delight to the UI, then collaborate with engineering and marketing to make sure your vision is realized.\n\n   Design at Crew\n   Designers are the glue that connects form to function, that takes a spark of passion to an effective work of beauty. It's so much more than aesthetics--at Crew, we expect our designers to have a vision that transcends pixel pushing.
