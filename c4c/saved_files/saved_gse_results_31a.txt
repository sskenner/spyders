The software engineering team is involved in every step of our process, building the automation that allows Kairos to not only image things that humans have never seen before, but to do it reliably, repeatably, inexpensively, and quickly. (Yes, you can have all four). We work primarily in Python, with a smattering of Bash, Ansible, Go and Typescript when it makes sense. We work on single-board-computers, field laptops, in virtualized cloud environments, in containers, inside of web browsers, and even inside lab automation frameworks. We practice compositional engineering, tying together disparate pieces of technology to create novel artifacts that solve real-world problems.
