Our software ties together everything companies know about their customers, processes massive quantities of data in real-time, and uses it drive a platform that's part CRM, part analytics engine and 100% an email platform that gets results.\n   Technology has come a long way in the last 15 years, but email hasn't really changed. We're here to fix that.\n\n   Engineering at Klaviyo\n   We love programming and the excitement that comes with building something people use.

Our background as a team is building these models for the Fortune 50 and we want to democratize and open up that technology to everyone.\n\n   The ideal candidate has a background in math, statistics and computer engineering and has worked from statistical distributions all the way to a trained and tested model. We use a wide variety of data mining and machine learning algorithms including regressions, decision trees, k-means clustering and neural nets. The right candidate will have deep experience with at least some of these machine learning techniques.\n\n   Our goal is always to match the right assumptions and models to the right problem -- they don't necessarily have to be complex. You should have experience building models that are used by people to make better decisions, we're focused on shipping early and often. We prefer iterative solutions that are incrementally better to the perfect solution. You should also be able to measure and know what impact your models had on the decisions people made -- e.g. did they outperform the previous best model or a human decision maker?\n\n   Our customers have large and varied data sets, you should have experience working with data at scale and with data sets that are sparse, incomplete and may require normalization. You'll work side by side with our analytics and data teams, which are responsible for storing and aggregating the large quantity of data that comes into Klaviyo.\n\n   Our data science team is still in it's early days, you'll be a founding member and expected to have a big impact on the direction and products we ship that help our customers learn and grow from their data.\n\nYou Will:\n\n     * Have a background in statistics and understand of different distributions and the conditions under which they're valid (e.g. when is independence necessary and how do you test for this).\n     * Have experience with machine learning algorithms such as regressions, decision trees, k-means clustering and neural nets.\n     * Understand Bayesian modeling techniques and how those influence the model building process.\n     * Have experience cleaning and normalizing data sets as well as create holdout data sets to test and validate models on.\n     * Have used data science packages to train and validate models. We use Python, so Pandas, NumPy and SciPy are all packages we're used to.\n     * Have demonstrated a measurable impact based on the models you've created. It's not always easy getting a model correct, we love talking about places we got stuck and work as a team to think through ideas that could unblock us.\n     * Not required, but it's a plus if you're comfortable with web frameworks (we use Django) to wrap models in APIs that can be consumed by other product teams or our customers directly. Our engineering team makes it easy to deploy and manage services.\n     * Not required, but it's a plus if you have experience with distributed algorithms for analyzing and modeling off of distributed data sets.\n\nYou Have:\n\n     * Bachelor's degree in computer science, applied mathematics, statistics or other relevant quantitative disciplines, or equivalent industry experience.\n     * Deep understanding of statistical distributions and linear algebra.\n     * Have worked in a data science role for 3+ years professionally or academically and can talk about the projects and techniques you used.\n     * Experience with Python and data science packages such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, etc.\n     * Experience with SQL and databases -- we use both SQL and \"NoSQL\" databases such as Cassandra.\n\n   About Us\n\n   Klaviyo is a team of people who are crazy motivated by growth.\n   It's what we help our customers do: grow their businesses by making it possible and easy for them to use their data to power better marketing.\n   It's how we behave as individuals: we're all deeply passionate about learning.\n   It's how we manage our business: we have thousands of paying customers, we're profitable, and we're growing insanely fast.\n   And it's what our culture is all about.

If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way.

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition. Disabilities include, but are not limited to:\n     * Blindness\n     * Deafness\n     * Cancer\n     * Diabetes\n     * Epilepsy\n     * Autism\n     * Cerebral palsy\n     * HIV/AIDS\n     * Schizophrenia\n     * Muscular dystrophy\n     * Bipolar disorder\n     * Major depression\n     * Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n     * Missing limbs or partially missing limbs\n     * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n     * Obsessive compulsive disorder\n     * Impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair\n     * Intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation)\n\nReasonable Accommodation Notice\n\n   Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities. Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.\n\n   Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. For more information about this form or the equal employment obligations of Federal contractors, visit the U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.\n\n   PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.\n\n   The Role\n\n   Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers' greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.\n\n   FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers' hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like \"Why are we losing customers?\" or \"How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?\" FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.\n\n   You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world's most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers.\n\nTechnologies We Use\n\n     * Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments\n     * Custom applications built on top of core Palantir platforms\n     * Postgres, Cassandra, Hadoop, and Spark for distributed data storage and parallel computing\n     * Java and Groovy for our back-end applications and data integration tools\n     * Typescript, React, Leaflet, and d3 for our web technologies\n     * Python for data processing and analysis\n     * Palantir cloud infrastructure based on AWS EC2 and S3\n\nOur Principles\n\n     * Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.\n     * Dedication: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.\n     * Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds -- such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.\n     * Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities--we don't micromanage. We want to give people the space to think for themselves.\n     * Growth: We push ourselves and our peers to improve themselves and the world around them.\n     * Learning: We often face entirely novel problems, where we need to pick up a lot of new information and learn how to use it to make progress.\n\nWhat We Value\n\n     * Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.\n     * Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.\n     * Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you're building.\n     * Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.\n     * Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.\n     * Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.\n     * Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.\n\n   Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer.

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition. Disabilities include, but are not limited to:\n     * Blindness\n     * Deafness\n     * Cancer\n     * Diabetes\n     * Epilepsy\n     * Autism\n     * Cerebral palsy\n     * HIV/AIDS\n     * Schizophrenia\n     * Muscular dystrophy\n     * Bipolar disorder\n     * Major depression\n     * Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n     * Missing limbs or partially missing limbs\n     * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n     * Obsessive compulsive disorder\n     * Impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair\n     * Intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation)\n\nReasonable Accommodation Notice\n\n   Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities. Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.\n\n   Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Your job is not to build the airplane -- it's to make sure all of the pieces fit together, that the ride is smooth, safe, and enjoyable for everyone on board, and that the plane stays in the air (which we think is pretty important).\n\nSome of the things IQEs have done in the past year include:\n\n     * Rebuild a production system to improve performance and scale by an order of magnitude.\n     * Advise on the best architecture for new products.\n     * Run weekly releases for customer's production systems.\n     * Respond to, debugging, and fixing exigent issues for customers globally.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n     * Drive software architecture discussions and decisions.\n     * Write automation code and develop automation frameworks.\n     * Participate in every stage of the product life cycle.\n     * Design and execute test cases using functional requirements.\n     * Find, understand, and debug product issues.\n     * Work with Software Developers, Product Designers, Forward Deployed Software Engineers, Product Managers, and others to ship high quality releases.\n     * Embed with our customer-facing teams to understand the issues that they face deploying and using our products.\n\nWhat We Value\n\n     * BS in Engineering, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Physics, or comparable experience.\n     * Ability to thrive and create order in a fast-moving, unstructured environment.\n     * Excellent teamwork, independent decision making, and communication skills.\n     * Analytical thinking, creative problem-solving skills and great attention to detail.\n     * Experience working with complex systems (software, biological, mechanical, etc.) and the desire and ability to understand them in detail.\n     * Scripting abilities, experience working in Java, C++, C, Go, Scala, Python, Bash, or Javascript, or the ability to learn these skills.\n     * Understanding of testing methodologies, preferably backend and scale testing.\n\n   If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, you may contact us at accommodations@palantir.com or you may call us at +1 (650) 473-9158.\n\n   Apply for this job\n",

Part of this mandate is to invest in the Affirm Anywhere offering which provides powerful search and discovery tools that let customers find relevant themes, categories, merchants and discounts where they can save money and use Affirm financing. The team's work is a critical part of Affirm's mission to become a trusted financial partner for our customers, and to help them live their best and most fulfilling financial lives. You can think of the team as R&D or a \"startup within a startup\" working on the next generation of Affirm products.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\n     * Lead technical projects from specification and planning, through execution & coding with multiple engineers, to testing and deployment into production\n     * Design and implement new product features, as well as extend core platform services and APIs to support those features\n     * Architect and build the web frontend for our Affirm Anywhere offering\n     * Analyze/debug performance issues on the frontend and across distributed services\n     * Plan, design, and build our core platform software and systems to scale with an increasing number of users, features, business requirements, partners, and new engineers\n     * Provide mentoring to more junior engineers in their progress on business and personal career goals\n\nWhat We Look For\n\n     * Passion and drive to change consumer finance for the better\n     * Experience building real-time distributed web services in the Consumer or SaaS space\n     * Ability to pick up new technologies quickly\n     * Strong software engineering fundamentals are far more important than familiarity with specific tools or languages\n     * Emphasis on writing clear, readable, testable code\n\nNice to have\n\n     * Experience working on growth hacking projects\n     * Interest in or experience with recommendation systems\n     * Python expertise\n\n   ABOUT AFFIRM\n   At Affirm we are using technology to re-imagine and re-build core parts of financial infrastructure to enable cheaper, friendlier and more transparent financial products and services that improve lives.\n\n   We believe the financial industry is fundamentally broken. Not only is the core infrastructure built with technology from the 1970s, but there are a dwindling number of people who say \"I trust my bank to look out for me\". It doesn't have to be this way, and it's our mission to fix this problem.\n\n   We are based in San Francisco; founded by Max Levchin (founding CTO PayPal), Jeff Kaditz (CDO DeNA/ngmoco), and Nathan Gettings (founding CTO of Palantir); and building a team of exceptionally talented people to join us on our mission.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-04T12:59:26.033687", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-Time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-Time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Affirm - Engineering Manager - Full Stack", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/affirm/72b6156d-943b-4f9a-af2b-250cb3fb4d59", "description": "   Affirm's mission is to build honest financial products to improve user's lives.

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.
