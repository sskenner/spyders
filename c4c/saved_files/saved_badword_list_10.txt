We were founded in 2013 by a team of executives from Facebook and Intel, with the mission of making data a part of everyone's day. We started by building a new kind of database from the ground up that is optimized to work with timestamped event data (timestamp, actor and action) and then added high performance primitives for asking behavioral questions. We expanded that into a full stack solution with an elegant UI to make it accessible to everyone. We now have customers who use our software to store trillions of rows of data, and to process hundreds of millions of rows per second, per core.

The platform we build provides brands a single tool that orchestrates the entire flow of commerce from the online store through delivery, including inventory and fulfillment. Unlike most commerce offerings, our focus is creating a platform where it's easy to create a customized and scalable commerce experience.\n\n   What makes our platform compelling to users is also a major technical challenge for our engineering team, since we cover the same scope traditionally provided by 3 or more different technologies. This range gives us the opportunity to work on a wide variety of problems as an engineering team, and enables us to do things that are almost impossible on other platforms (like real-time availability changes on the website.)\n\n   The quality of Statistical Models, Reporting, and Analytics are as good as the quality of the data available at the source. At Symphony we are building real time big data pipeline on the cloud that collects, connects, and centralizes all data into a single source of truth which makes data available, reliable, and accurate to support all our data needs. You will be playing a key role in the organization and with our customers in enabling effective data driven decisions. You will have your fingerprint in the conception of ideas, design, and execution across all the data functions.

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.\n\n   Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

Some example core feature areas we work on today are: prediction-driven scheduling UI, calendar and preference modeling, load-balanced contractor task distribution, and advanced payment allocation algorithms.\n\n   We're looking for folks with prior experience building products and fostering team collaboration. In this role, you will jump in as tech lead on projects and help guide architectural designs. You will also play a key part role in team development: mentoring and enabling team members, helping to introduce and guide best practices.\n\n   You should have experience in at least one of the following and familiarity across the full stack:\n\n   o Systems Engineering: e.g., real time & distributed system architecture.\n   o Data Modeling: e.g., recurrence based data modeling, expert-systems modeling.\n   o Protocols & API Integrations: e.g.,messaging protocols (e-mail, SMS), calendaring protocols, & third party API integrations.\n\n   Additionally, we're looking for engineers that are customer focused, collaborative, and excited to pursue difficult, often loosely defined problems.\n\n   Nice to have(s):\n   o Experience with React/Redux.\n   o Experience with Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and AWS.\n\n   Optionally with your resume:\n   o A cover letter explaining why you think you are a great match for Clara.\n   o A link to a Github repo of yours.\n   o Tell us about one of your interesting projects!\n\n   We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-04T19:14:53.741933", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Clara - Front-end Software Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/claralabs/0c0680b6-bd9d-4671-aaff-37ff83010d08/apply", "description": "Submit your application\n\n     * Resume/CV\n       ATTACH RESUME/CV                     \n       Couldn't auto-read resume.\n       Analyzing resume...\n       Success!\n       File exceeds the maximum upload size of 100MB.
