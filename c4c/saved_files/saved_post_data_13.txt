OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency. For a more in-depth look at OT, here's a conference talk that Nate, our CTO, gave!\n\n   Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Graphana to see what's going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too!
