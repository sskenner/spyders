Our initial focus is on applying the latest advances in computer vision and machine learning to medical imaging. Over the long-term, we are conducting research to drive the next set of breakthroughs at the intersection of AI and medicine to transform early disease identification and management.\n\n   We're a team of leading scientists, engineers, clinicians, and industry professionals from some of the top healthcare and technology organizations across the globe. Our clinical team is comprised of radiologists and surgeons from Mayo Clinic, Stanford Hospital, Hospital for Special Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital, and others. Imagen's technical team is comprised of machine learning PhDs and engineers with extensive experience doing research and building products at leading companies, including Google and Facebook.\n\n   We were founded in 2015 in NYC and have raised $21m from leading venture capitalists, hospitals and health systems, and technology entrepreneurs. Our institutional investors include: Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Allen & Company, and Euclidean Capital.\n\n   Role Background\n\n   We are looking for a Director of Strategic Partnerships & Sales responsible for independently establishing and managing relationships with potential partners and customers. Over the next 12 months, this role will be largely focused on supporting product development by acquiring large-scale medical datasets from providers and payers. This role will gradually shift away from dataset acquisition towards cultivating our initial customer base in order to hit aggressive sales targets for AI-based diagnostic products that are not yet widespread in healthcare. This is initially an individual contributor role reporting into the co-CEO, with the potential to hire and manage 2-4 direct reports over the next 24 months.\n\nYour day-to-day will include:\n\n     * Working with the executive leadership team to evolve our commercial strategy.\n     * Cultivating relationships with potential partners and customers, including payers and providers - both in the U.S. and internationally.\n     * Maintaining strong relationships with our expansive network of existing strategic partners (large U.S. based health systems).\n     * Leading development of sales collateral -- including presentations, one pagers, and demos.\n     * Gathering and synthesizing customer insights from the market for our product team.\n\nSuccess in the first 18 months will be achieved when:\n\n     * You have built a strong rapport with our strategic partners, and have used that foundation to deepen our relationship with these partners.\n     * You continue to build upon our large medical imagery dataset by striking 2 new strategic partnerships.\n     * You have developed an initial commercial strategy and have met the aggressive sales targets that you and the executive team have set.\n\nYou will love this job if:\n\n     * You want to have an impact with your work. You will play a central role in advancing our mission of revolutionizing healthcare to positively impact billions of people.\n     * You are extremely competitive and persistent and you thrive on rejection. Sales is often hard and you eagerly take the lessons from failure and use those to drive improved commercial strategies that ultimately deliver success.\n     * You understand people: you recognize that we are all built differently; you gather and synthesize insights on what drives individual behavior and are adept at pulling those insights into targeted, actionable strategies that move people and organizations where you want them to go.\n     * You are eager to build long-term relationships with partners and customers; you are not just wired to `make the sale' and move on.\n     * You know how to carry a room through polished and compelling presentation skills.\n     * You apply sound logic to develop thoughtful opinions, but you hold those opinions loosely and always seek out countervailing views and evidence.\n     * You are comfortable with ambiguity -- early-stage companies and the roles within them are messy, and you are excited to establish structure around you.\n\nWe want to hear from you if:\n\n     * You have 5+ years of experience at a top-tier consulting firm (McKinsey, Bain, BCG).\n     * You have consistently been in the top 20% of your cohort within these environments.\n     * You have experience developing and managing client relationships, with a particular focus on the C-suite.\n     * You have worked in partnerships / sales at an early-stage company.\n     * You are willing to travel up to 75% of the time.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-11T02:48:44.220409", "lat": 40.7127753, "lng": -74.0059728, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Improbable - Software Engineer, Enterprise", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/improbable/5114a06b-bb0b-477b-909c-1ae75329e0f8", "description": "   _about us\n\n   The physical world is a staggeringly complex environment, comprised of countless levels of dynamic, interacting systems.
