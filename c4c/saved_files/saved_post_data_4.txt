You naturally question it if ever have to a problem more than once.\n   * You have experience in building and leading engineering teams. You are a natural mentor and like the process of spreading knowledge around. Sharing good practices and mentoring team members is a significant part of the role and you truly like to do it too.\n   * You have a good understanding of trade-offs between business goals and technical imperfection. You know enough to not make those religious debates and are known to find the optimal mix of solutions that are right for the company.\n   * You'd be a thought leader and mentor the engineering team on technical, architectural, design and other related issues.\n   * You are truly hands-on and expect to build software as part of your day.\n   * You will proactively identify architectural weaknesses and recommend appropriate solutions, perform functional and code reviews in related areas within and across product engineering team.\n   * On a day to day, you'll conduct architectural reviews with one or more teams and brainstorm on methods to solve technical challenges.\n\n   Paytm is a fun place to work and provides scale and related technology challenges that are available for you to get your hands dirty with.
