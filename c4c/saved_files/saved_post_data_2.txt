At least 1 year of research experience demonstrating capabilities in analytical chemistry is highly desired.\n\nResponsibilities may include\n\n     * Run and QC unit operations associated with strain testing including: cultivation, sample extraction, assays and analytics.\n     * Assisting with design, development and improvement of unit operations.\n     * Assisting with the preparation and purification of prospective Ginkgo products and blends.\n     * Analyzing large data sets and communicating results to the team.\n\nRequirements\n\n     * BS or MS in chemistry, bioengineering, chemical engineering or related fields\n     * Experience with analytical methods like LC-MS, HPLC, GC-MS (or FID) or NGS\n     * Familiarity with software or laboratory automation is a plus\n\n   To learn more about Ginkgo, check us out on Wired and BuzzFeed:\n\n   http://www.wired.com/2015/11/move-over-jony-ivebiologists-are-the-next-rock-star-designers/\n   http://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/this-startup-is-designing-yeast-to-make-brand-new-scents-fla#.ph2jnprJK\n\n   We also feel it's important to point out the obvious here - there's a serious lack of diversity in our industry and it needs to change.  Our goal is to help drive that change. We hope to continue to build a company whose culture promotes inclusion and embraces how rewarding it is to work with engineers from all walks of life.  Making biology easier to engineer is a tough nut to crack - we can't afford to leave any talent untapped.\n\n   It is the policy of Ginkgo Bioworks to provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and employment applicants.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-04T11:54:36.626830", "lat": 42.3600825, "lng": -71.0588801, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Intern", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Intern"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Opendoor - Software Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/opendoor/cf102953-5e15-4329-bb22-95f53a5fed43", "description": "   About Opendoor\n\n   At Opendoor, we're on a mission to make it simple to buy and sell homes.
