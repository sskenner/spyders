Java Software Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/canva/82736406-04f0-4375-aa69-1c02b39d4138", "description": "   At Canva, we work every day to make a significant positive impact on society. Our mission is to democratise design and empower creativity for anyone and everyone, on every platform!\n\n   Since launch in April 2013 we have grown exponentially, amassing over 10 million users in over 40 languages. We are one of the world's fastest growing technology companies. We're growing rapidly and building a product that users really love -- just check out Twitter!\n\n   Engineering is a core part of who we are. Working with our existing team of a carefully selected of ex-Google, VMware, ThoughtWorks, and Atlassian engineers, we pride in our focus on software engineering fundamentals and pragmatism. The team strives to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, and to strike a measured balance between getting things done and long term maintainability.\n\n   We also love to have fun. For example, we name our releases alphabetically around themes. We've recently done \"cheese of the world\", \"muppets characters,\" and \"Crayola colours.\" We've done an Australian slang-themed set of release names that has included \"mozzie\" (meaning mosquitoes) and \"ripper\" (meaning really good). Imagine the whole place erupting in laughter when the release cop yells: \"Pushing Kermit to Prod!\" - it's the everyday little things that make Canva an enjoyable place to work and solve problems.\n\n   The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimising performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code. We also have a flat structure where engineers are invited to comment on the direction their peers are taking and are paired for peer-reviewing of code to occur. This ensures that knowledge around the code base is shared and speed of release is quick and efficient. To dig into the in and outs of engineering at Canva, here's an article written by our CTO, Dave, discussing how we get things done.\n\n   Finally, if you're curious about some of our technology, the Canva backend is a microservices environment, on AWS, built primarily in Java, with a mix of powerful libraries as well as some bespoke components.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n     * As an individual contributor - work closely with your leads, designers, and product managers to deliver great products that delight our 10+ million customers all over the world.\n     * Bring new ideas to the table with respect to how we can streamline processes and build better solutions\n     * Engage in technical discussions and the design and build-out of new features\n     * Identify and address performance bottlenecks within the application and broader infrastructure\n     * Participate in design meetings, interviews, and code reviews\n     * Communicate with other team members to figure out the best solutions to difficult problems\n     * Passion for performance debugging, benchmarking, building awesome things, and picking up new technologies and skills.\n\nRequirements\n\n     * At least 2+ years of commercial experience developing complex web-based applications in Java.

As we build out our organisation and operations, we need highly motivated, intellectually curious and flexible individuals capable of taking on key areas of responsibility and helping drive the business forward.\n\n   The PDM will be responsible for overall delivery management and reporting for delivery of Platform Network Services, liaising closely with Software Engineering, and will be prepared to pitch in to help the relevant teams perform, identifying gaps, resolving issues and helping out with specific tasks, including individual project management, where necessary.\n   The role will fulfil a PMO-like function within an Agile environment, augmenting Agile processes with high level progress reporting and issue tracking and resolution, and the PDM will be responsible for defining how their own role develops as the organisation grows.\n   The PDM will be critical in ensuring the smooth running of multiple aspects of Platform delivery while enabling the Platform leadership to focus on strategic planning and the Development team to focus on Corda development.\n\n   The successful candidate for this role will have solid experience in delivery management involving technology and be able to demonstrate an understanding of legal, regulatory and market issues impacting one or more business domains. Experience in Financial Services is strongly preferred, but is not essential for outstanding candidates.\n   The candidate must have experience of leading teams responsible for technology and operational change across the full delivery lifecycle, and be adept at developing and managing detailed project plans, including managing dependencies across multiple workstreams.\n   They must be an excellent communicator, and have operated in fast-moving, innovative and multicultural environments. They will be able to evidence their ability to balance multiple competing priorities, and be prepared to get involved in any aspect of delivery, not just managing others.\n\n   They must be familiar with technical concepts and issues, showing a demonstrable interest and appetite for novel technology in general, and be able to evidence management and delivery skills in innovative technical environments. Financial Services experience is again preferred, rather than essential.\n   The PDM will report into the Head of Delivery, taking guidance from the Chief Technology Officer and Chief Engineer. The PDM will be a member of Platform Exco which runs the day-to-day Platform business and organisation.\n   The PDM will work with the Head of Delivery and Strategy, Product Management, Architecture, DevOps and Software Engineering teams to deliver the Network Services, while also liaising with stakeholders at member banks and the broader community as required.\n\n   Responsibilities\n   \ufffd       Support the Head of Delivery in delivering the objectives and milestones for Network Services set out in the R3 Annual Plan, taking overall ownership for delivery across multi-disciplinary teams.\n   \ufffd       Establish and manage a suitably elaborated project plan for the Agile delivery of the Network Services and be responsible for overall status reporting and issue and risk management on all relevant activities across the Platform organisation\n   \ufffd       Ensure suitable Agile project management disciplines are applied in all areas of delivery, from requirements through to implementation, with appropriate plan management, prioritisation, dependency management and reporting\n   \ufffd       Provide PMO support to the Platform Head of Delivery, ensuring regular status reports are produced on time and to the required level of quality. Act as back-up for the Head of Delivery as required\n   \ufffd       Take ownership of Platform internal planning and budgeting processes and deliverables, including 5 year financial forecasts\n   \ufffd       Liaise with Legal and Regulatory teams to ensure all legal and regulatory dependencies are reliably managed and tracked\n   \ufffd       Be prepared to `get the hands dirty' and support individual project activities where required and appropriate (depending on individual skills)\n   \ufffd       Contribute to general management activities and strategic planning within the Platform Organisation, and be part of the Platform Exco.\n\n   Skills\n   \ufffd       Excellent project management skills, with proven ability to deliver in fast-paced Agile environments, and the flexibility to adapt plans and solutions\n   \ufffd       Highly organised and professional, with exceptional verbal and written communication skills. A passion for resolving aspiration into a clear vision and then driving through to delivery.\n   \ufffd       Familiar with Agile development disciplines and `test and learn' product development cycles.\n   \ufffd       Pragmatic, able to see the wood for the trees and ensure activity is always directed according to the right priorities\n   \ufffd       High enthusiasm for, and awareness of, the competitive advantages technology can bring to business in general, and financial services specifically\n   \ufffd       Ability and willingness to rapidly learn about a new technology and business area, and apply that learning to develop appropriate solutions\n   \ufffd       Able to work collaboratively in a widely diverse workforce and an innovative and open culture. Able to converse easily at all levels of the organisation.\n   \ufffd       Ability to self-motivate and take ownership and responsibility for tasks, with the diligence and persistence to complete them to a high standard.\n   \ufffd       Ability to work successfully in a start-up environment. Comfortable with ambiguity and willing to work beyond the strict wording of the job description in order to achieve the firm's objectives.\n   \ufffd       Experience in managing commercial suppliers, and a familiarity with legal and contractual matters.\n   \ufffd       Ability to build and motivate virtual teams through strong team leadership and people-management skills.\n   \ufffd       Capital Markets and/or core Banking technology experience is not mandatory but a plus.\n   \ufffd       The role is based in London but there may be the need to travel from time to time. R3 is a global organisation.\n\n   About R3\n   Blockchain technology is revolutionising banking and finance. R3 is a unique Fintech company with more than 70 global financial institutions as members, dedicated to harnessing the power of blockchain for the global finance community. R3 has developed its own ground-breaking blockchain platform called Corda and is moving rapidly into production pilot with a range of financial applications in late 2017.\n   To support these pilot applications R3 is developing a suite of Network Services that safeguard the integrity and performance of the underlying ledgers and deliver shared solutions for common activities such as monitoring, reporting and compliance.\n   We have identified a set of core Network Services to be offered for pilot this year and are designing out the initial solutions and a future development roadmap. It is vital that the Services are robust from the outset due to the immutable aspect of the first ledger records.\n\n   About Corda\n   R3 is building the Financial Services Industry's premier Distributed Ledger Technology software platform `Corda'. As the financial industry begins to move from PoC to Pilot in the second half of 2017, R3 needs to support emerging DLT applications with a comprehensive production environment supporting a range of Network Services to be delivered by R3 and its partners that enable working ledgers on the software platform.\n   Financial Institutions running Corda applications will operate via one or more Nodes which connect with other Nodes over the open internet or via private network links and protected with TLS.
