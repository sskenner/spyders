Work like hell and advertise.\"\n   - Ted Turner\n\n   We're not your usual direct response company. Jumpcut is a Y Combinator and venture-backed startup whose mission is to create the most compelling educational content in the world.\n\n   We want to create courses that teach people the skills to live their dream life. We're starting with courses on social media, and plan to rapidly expand to other niches. (Aka. We do information marketing, and we're aiming to do it better than anyone else in the world... on both the marketing side AND the product side.)\n\n   How are we different?\n\n   Well - for one, we've got a team of engineers that can create our own custom marketing tools, software, and systems. That opens up a LOT of opportunity for putting your ideas into action. Because of that, we're never limited by what tools are available on the market. (We've also got an in-house production team that kicks ass, and helps us create that world-class educational content I mentioned before.)\n\n   Now, in order to achieve our mission, we need to hire the best. A top performer who fits into our risk-taking DNA.\n\n   JOB SUMMARY\n\n   Right now, we're currently looking for a full-time Direct Response Copywriter. Someone who is obsessed with writing amazing copy and striving to become the best in the world at it. Someone that spends their free time constantly researching, learning, and growing their skills. Someone who has a deep desire to connect with people's emotions using words.\n\n   You're going to be part of a team that is moving incredibly quickly. The speed with which we implement new ideas is likely faster than you've ever experienced. You'll get a 360 degree view of how the business works and it will be your ideas that help us grow even faster. We're not necessarily looking for an expert (but we're definitely open to it).\n\n   Our main criteria is: will this person quickly learn and grow with the company? We want to see you grow into new roles beyond copywriting. So if you're interested in not only being a world-class copywriter -- but also a world-class marketer -- then this position is perfect for you.\n\nWHAT YOU'LL DO\n\n     * Writing emails to market and sell digital products.\n     * Writing compelling copy for email opt-in pages.\n     * Helping to strategize and write long-form sales letters and VSLs.\n     * Writing engaging story/advice emails to build relationships with potential customers.\n     * Coming up with creative ideas for Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram Ads.\n\nWHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR\n\n     * The ability to self-manage. There will be times when you receive an open-ended project. You'll be expected to fill in the details and come up with a strategy.\n     * An eye for innovation. Someone who takes an assigned project, and makes it even better. We're not looking for someone who simply \"does what they're told.\" Each project is an opportunity to innovate.\n     * A self-learner. The best marketers are the ones who continue to learn outside the job. They read books, take courses, brainstorm ideas - all on their own.\n\n   This is a full-time role, with the option to either work remotely or in our office in Hollywood, California. Our salary is extremely competitive, with great benefits including stock options, catered lunch/dinner every day (for those in office), 401k, health care, and best of all: lots of room for growth.\n\n   The first step of our application process is a simple questionnaire to determine if you're a good fit. These are a series of intentionally broad questions that will allow us to get to know you. There's only one rule: answer honestly. Your answers can be as long or short as you'd like -- we're just looking for clarity of thought.\n\n   Please click the button below to submit your resume/cover letter, and get started on the questionnaire.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-11T03:28:32.638269", "lat": 34.0522342, "lng": -118.2436849, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Jumpcut - Executive Sales Funnel Builder", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/jumpcut/8c6718c9-fe88-4043-bbd6-43c2c686818f", "description": "   THE COMPANY\n\n   \"The greatest mistake marketers make is trying to create demand.\"\n   - Eugene Schwartz\n\n   Jumpcut is a Y Combinator and venture-backed startup that creates cinematic online courses with the world's biggest influencers.\n\n   The founding team at Jumpcut has years of experience creating binge-worthy content -- we've created multiple viral YouTube channels that now have over 4.5 million subscribers and over 500 million views.

In an ice cream parlor of unlimited flavors, every other online education company has opted for vanilla. We have our eye on the mint triple chocolate chip birthday cake cookie dough with strawberry whipped cream and banana nut sprinkles.\n\n   Our team is approaching online learning in a completely new way: combining educational content with compelling stories, captivating cinematography, creative soundtracks, and much more.

Rachel and Sam are based in SF with Ana and you being based in London. We have a great culture with lots going on. The people who will enjoy working here are the ones that like to get involved. Tuesday drinks, to let off some steam. Bunday, if you fancy making some cakes for the team on a Monday. Team events once a month and much more.\n\n   This year the whole London team is heading off to SF in November. We believe in bringing everyone together and allowing people to forge friendships across the offices.\n\n   Why don't you apply and find out some more?\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n\n     * Responsibilities:Develop and drive the roadmap for Kalo public API and platform extensibility\n     * Discover user problems and needs with user research, market research, and in collaboration with our customer success and sales teams\n     * Partner with engineering and design to define customer workflows and solutions to customer problems\n     * Prioritise work based on what provides the most value to the customer and business Help drive go to market activities for product releases\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\n     * BS or MS in computer science, electrical engineering or similar field or experience as a\n     * Software Engineer, Designer or startup Founder 4-7 years or more working as a Product Manager\n     * Analyze and use data to inform decisions Deep understanding and empathy for users\n     * Launched multiple successful products and features, preferably on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, desktop, and web)\n     * Excellent written and oral communication skills\n     * Demonstrated the ability to lead teams and work cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment\n\n   At Kalo, we believe that work as we know it is undergoing a profound change.

Since then, a range of of companies from internet to fashion -- including Netflix, Asos, IDEO and AirBnB -- have been able to throw away their tangle of spreadsheets and invoice emails, and work together with their freelancer and vendor teams in a clean, beautiful experience. Our own team at Kalo is just getting started.\n\n   Located in London and San Francisco, we are super excited about the opportunity ahead of us.

Interviewing is a time consuming process that is rarely data-driven. Here at Karat, we see a massive opportunity to transform the interviewing experience for every candidate and company.\n\n   Karat is on a mission to assess the world's talent.  We are the first dedicated marketplace for technical interviewers. Karat's network of seasoned engineers conduct the first rounds of technical interviews for elite engineering companies. Our robust platform saves teams thousands of valuable hours while allowing them to focus on the top performing candidates.  Karat's unique approach recognizes that people are central to the hiring process and that they can be supercharged by leveraging machine learning and our rich database of the world's interviews.\n\n   We face incredible demand for our service and are delivering significant value to elite engineering companies like Interana, BuildZoom and Minted.  We are funded by top VCs including Formation8 and Founder Collective, plus the founders of companies like Glassdoor, Mulesoft, Lookout, OPOWER, MediaLink and CAA.  Karat is headquartered in the University District of Seattle, WA.\n\n   Customer Success at Karat\n\n   Customers are our source of inspiration and focus at Karat.   You will be the primary advocate for customers and continuously aim to WOW them.
