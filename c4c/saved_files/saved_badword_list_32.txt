Maybe you dreamed of iteratively improving click-rates for an ad network or summoning cars, valets, groceries or places to stay overnight, but we bet you dreamed of making the world a better place. We help some of the world's best companies better capture energy from the sun and the wind, deliver safe water and produce life-saving medicines. Seriously, these are the things we work on every day at Krypton. Our software collects billions of data points from millions of sensors to help maintenance and operations teams monitor, correlate and see asset-related data with more clarity. We provide our customers with instant, previously impossible-to-get insight, into the performance of machines that do important things. If you join us, it won't be a stretch to say that you are helping make the world a better place every day.\n\n   We are looking for a lead engineer to join our tight-knit team. You will be involved in the entire technology stack, from designing stream processing pipelines to building web services that need to run with high availability at scale. You will be responsible for architecting full data processing flows, from raw data to the application of machine learning techniques. Your work will involve design and development of systems for data collection, data processing, data correction, monitoring, data access and more. You will operate at the intersect of real machines and data science every day.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n     * Design and build core components of a first-of-its-kind data analytic application for maintenance and operations teams within asset intensive businesses.\n     * Grow your own skills and capabilities, surrounded by like-minded, crazy-smart, passionate creators focused on building best-in-class products for a huge, woefully underserved market.\n     * Create products from the ground up. From idea inception through design to detailed completion, all of your work will be on the critical path for the team and the business.\n     * Drive development of end-to-end data management solutions that span ad-hoc, batch and stream data processing at scale.\n\nRequirements\n\n     * 5+ years of previous work experience and B.Sc. or M.Sc. in Computer Science or related field\n     * Sound fundamentals and commitment to quality (read: not this guy https://twitter.com/hipsterhacker )\n     * Expertise with Scala and/or Java and JVM internals\n     * Knowledge of distributed data systems such as Hadoop, Spark, HBase, Kafka et. al.\n     * Experience with AWS services such as EC2, S3 et. al.\n\n   Our office is in the heart of SoMa in San Francisco, with easy commute access (bike lanes, easy parking, MUNI, Bart), great coffee and eats. We provide competitive compensation including the kind of equity grant you can only get in an early stage company along with big-company benefits (100% paid medical, dental, vision, life, etc.). We can help with relocation and are open to H1-B transfers. We are venture-backed from some of the best names in early stage capital.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", "utc_datetime": "2017-10-11T03:47:15.774931", "lat": 37.7749295, "lng": -122.4194155, "country": "United States", "employment_type": "Full-time", "remote_ok": "doesnt_say", "time_commitment": "Full-time"}{"key": "5b26197b391c5dab05c5606d43fba9c6", "title": "Krypton - Software Engineer", "website": "https://jobs.lever.co/kryptoncloud/fea7222d-958f-42c0-bb7e-c12f236c3015/apply", "description": "Submit your application\n\n     * Resume/CV\n       ATTACH RESUME/CV                     \n       Couldn't auto-read resume.\n       Analyzing resume...\n       Success!\n       File exceeds the maximum upload size of 100MB.
