They collaborate with the VP of Engineering on technical vision, set standards across teams, resolve issues, and unblock complex problems. Lead Engineers are explicitly charged with vetting the technical rigor of our solutions.\n\n   As a Lead Engineer, two Team Leads will report into you.  You will help guide, coach, mentor, and develop their technical and leadership skills.\n\n   Lead Engineers split their time roughly 50/50 between coding and administrative (pr review / planning / architecture / 1:1's). Lead Engineers enjoy a great degree of autonomy in their work.  Their 50% coding time can be spent working with one of the teams below them or they can identify impactful work outside our traditional green light process to attack heads on.\n\nYOUR STRENGTHS\n\n     * A seasoned engineer with technical street cred passionate about open source who enjoys sharing your experience with the team through mentoring, and technical leadership\n     * Proven track record delivering SaaS products to market in a startup environment\n     * Experience coaching and developing engineers\n     * Passionate about writing code that is scalable, maintainable, reusable, and well-testedInterested in building reliable, fault-tolerant, production grade systems\n     * Feel comfortable debugging large applications and refactoring them to well-tested components and services\n     * Have experience designing, implementing, and maintaining APIs as a service for your team and customers\n     * Enjoy optimizing complex data models for understandability and performance\n     * While it can be hard to measure experience strictly in terms of time,  you should have a strong, proven background in Javascript and Node.js.

If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition. Disabilities include, but are not limited to:\n     * Blindness\n     * Deafness\n     * Cancer\n     * Diabetes\n     * Epilepsy\n     * Autism\n     * Cerebral palsy\n     * HIV/AIDS\n     * Schizophrenia\n     * Muscular dystrophy\n     * Bipolar disorder\n     * Major depression\n     * Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n     * Missing limbs or partially missing limbs\n     * Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n     * Obsessive compulsive disorder\n     * Impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair\n     * Intellectual disability (previously called mental retardation)\n\nReasonable Accommodation Notice\n\n   Federal law requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities. Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.\n\n   Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.
