Lever solves the #1 challenge for every CEO: hiring. Recruiting is a hot market, growing 12-15% y/y on its own, and Applicant Tracking Systems like Lever are in high demand. At the same time, hiring has never been more competitive and costly, making talent solutions that improve a company's hiring ROI incredibly valuable. We've just brought our product out of beta and we've already attracted an elite roster of customers including Box, Quora, Lyft, Coursera, Foursquare, Slack, Reddit, and GitHub.\n\n   Lever is the only hiring software that is mobilizing the entire company to collaborate on hiring. We're the only solution designed to engage managers, who are incredibly crucial stakeholders, more deeply in the process. By supporting a true partnership between recruiters and managers, we're able to make hiring faster, higher-quality, and more embedded into a company's core culture.\n\n   We are seeking a resourceful, driven, results-oriented sales professional to help us set, drive, and execute our revenue goals.
