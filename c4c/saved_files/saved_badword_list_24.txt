This Democratic Tech team will work closely with candidates, parties, and constituents to make a measurable impact in their ability to execute. Our mission: secure the future of our country. Our need: you.\n\n   Come join us. We are about to change everything.\n\n   Who we are and who we want to be\n\n   The Democratic Tech team is a small and diverse team that understands the power of technology to help accelerate change, and our mission is to secure the future of our country. Our team already powers the technology that candidates and organizers use in all 3,413 counties and all 50 states across the United States -- but we're hiring engineers, researchers, product managers, designers, security experts, IT professionals, and data scientists who can bring the philosophies of user-centered design and rapid iteration, as well as world-class tools and experiences to this work. We must build rock solid infrastructure and tools to enable state parties to best support their candidates and voters, and amplify the progressive message. This team is responsible for driving the Democratic party forward with technology.\n\n   The team's goals are to:\n\n   Understand the needs of Democratic candidates, state parties, and constituents, and make a measurable impact in their ability to execute. Make available secure and foundational technology for all Democratic candidates so they can harness world-class data analytics, run grassroots organizing and voter empowerment programs, raise money, and use cutting-edge technology to get their messages out. Provide tools to democratic voters and the American people who want to make an impact for the Democratic party and our country.Build an ecosystem of progressive technology by partnering with other enthusiastic companies and organizations, and creating connections and opportunities for us to amplify each other.\n\n   To that end, we will be working on everything from data, to voter and volunteer mobilization and registration, reaching out to the American people to engage them, as well as all the supporting work needed to help Democrats in all ways that we can (e.g. training).\n\n   About this job\n\n   This is a mid-level to senior \"full-stack\" role either located in our Washington, DC offices -- or remotely from wherever you may be based. Previous political technology experience is not required, but we're looking for technically flexible people who can tackle any challenge that may arise -- whether it means writing backend code in Python, debugging JavaScript, authoring HTML / CSS, shepherding a data sync, releasing an API, or using and designing data models. You will be working on the Democratic Tech team to begin implementing best practices and lessons learned in private and non-governmental industries. This includes open-sourcing as much as we can, participating in and sometimes leading design reviews, and getting into a quick deploy / measure / refine loop with everything we put out there. We will be working on technology around data analytics, grassroots organizing, voter empowerment, fundraising, and get-the-message-out just to name a few. And, you will also be working to lay down\n   a foundation so others may do this work faster the next time.\n\n   You will work with others around the DNC as well as around the country. Beyond writing software, you'll be debugging how people get work done today and how to make it more efficient, secure, and impactful. This includes identifying competing and conflicting efforts and making recommendations on how to align them. We strongly believe that sometimes the biggest impact we can make is not actually to write software.\n\nWhy should you do this?\n\n     * You have a mission to do nothing short of secure the future of our country. We are here because we will do everything we know how to do this. We believe that working at the DNC will give us the most leverage to pull this off;\n     * You get to work with amazing people. We're building a diverse team with people from a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and stories. You will get to work with engineers, campaign managers, volunteer coordinators, communication experts, and numerous others -- we're finding ways to celebrate our differences and use them to make our team better; and\n     * You will never stop learning. Few have walked this path, so you will be exploring and blazing a trail for others. Those who have hiked this path before us are absolutely willing to teach -- and they are amazing teachers.\n\nHowever, to be forthright:\n\n     * We've done a lot of budget hacking to get competitive when it comes to salaries. We know we can't beat Google, Facebook, and others, but we're not too far off to make us competitive.\n     * We're a distributed team. Some of us are based in Washington, DC, others of us are spread around the nation. This provides flexibility in the way we do our work, and we believe this lets us find the best people, no matter where they are. But, we also acknowledge that some people need the regularity of an office and physical proximity to co-workers.\n     * We're doing something aggressive. We know we are following a non-traditional path and are not in the private sector. We won't let this hold us back, but, there are different realities when it comes to fundraising and schedules (e.g. elections are immovable dates).\n\nWhat we're looking for\n\n     * We are currently looking for mid-level to senior engineers who are great communicators, have high emotional intelligence, value simplicity, are pragmatic, and have a bias to action. You do not need to have experience in politics or civic tech to apply, nor do you have to be an overly political person. We are looking for those who are passionate about building products to support our candidates and our voters. Those people are and have:\n     * Experience writing software professionally and independently owning projects from start to finish;\n     * Fluent in at least one programming language (Python or JavaScript preferred); and\n     * An understanding and experience with cloud-based services; and\n     * Technical flexibility and no dogma around implementation (but rather passion about making a difference).\n\nWe also love people who have:\n\n     * A desire to collaborate and work closely with cross-functional partners;\n     * A natural curiosity and humility to the way you approach your work;\n     * A need to over-communicate in written form, in code comments, and to help break down silos; and\n     * A desire to change politics for the better, support the the Democratic party, and secure the future of our country.\n\n   The Democratic National Committee (DNC), is committed to diversity among its staff, and recognizes that its continued success requires the highest commitment to obtaining and retaining a diverse staff that provides the best quality services to supporters and constituents.

The overriding goal is to provide lift in the field for state parties and candidates.\n\n   Internally, you will lead a team focused on developing analytics products.

The Data Science Lead, as well as the Democratic Tech team as a whole, will work closely with candidates, parties, and constituents to make what we do efficient and effective. Our mission: optimize the future of our country. Our need: you.\n\n   Come join us. We are about to change everything.\n\n   Who we are and who we want to be\n   The Democratic Tech team is a small and diverse team that understands the power of technology to help accelerate change, and our mission is to secure the future of our country. Our team already powers the technology that candidates and organizers use in all 3,413 counties and all 50 states across the United States -- but we're hiring engineers, researchers, product managers, designers, security experts, IT professionals, and data scientists who can bring the philosophies of user-centered design and rapid iteration, as well as world-class tools and experiences, to this work. We must build rock-solid infrastructure and tools to enable state parties to support their candidates and voters, and amplify the progressive message. This team is responsible for driving the Democratic party forward with technology.\n\n   The team's goals are to:\n   - Understand the needs of Democratic candidates, state parties, and constituents, and make a measurable impact on their ability to execute.\n   - Make available secure and foundational technology for all Democratic candidates so they can harness world-class data analytics, run grassroots organizing and voter empowerment programs, raise money, and use cutting-edge technology to get their messages out.\n   - Provide tools to Democratic voters and the American people who want to make an impact for the Democratic party and our country.\n   - Build an ecosystem of progressive technology by partnering with other enthusiastic companies and organizations, and creating connections and opportunities for us to amplify each other.\n   - Change the culture of the Democratic party to be one around rapid iteration and moving quickly.\n\n   To that end, we will be working on everything from data to voter registration and volunteer mobilization, engaging the American people directly, as well as helping Democratic campaigns do the same (e.g. through training).\n\n   About this job\n   The Data Science Lead works with the Data Director and is concerned both with the near-term operational efficiency of the DNC, state parties, and various candidates, and with the long-range development of game-changing products. The overriding goal is to provide lift in the field for state parties and candidates.\n\n   Internally, you will lead a team focused on developing analytics products. Major (but not exhaustive) areas of work include building predictive models to inform resource allocation, designing and analyzing experiments for the DNC and other groups, and online panel and phone survey methodology. Externally, you will work with state parties and candidates to help them leverage those analytics products and promote their adoption.\n\n   You will work with other teams around the DNC as well as around the country. We strongly believe that sometimes the best work is the work we can avoid needing to do -- as they say, working smarter, not harder.\n\nWhy should you take up this challenge?\n\n     * You and your team will be able to work on fascinating problems: developing survey methodology for the post-phone era, figuring out the determinants of voter turnout, and learning how to integrate social media data into a major political party's field program. You'll never stop learning, and you'll certainly have stories to tell.\n     * You'll get to work with, and hire, amazing people. We're building a diverse team from a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and walks of life. You'll get to work with engineers, organizers, campaign managers, volunteer coordinators, communication experts, and numerous others -- we're finding ways to celebrate our differences and use them to make our team better; and\n     * Last, but certainly not least, you'll be in a high-leverage position. Rather than publishing papers or improving one organization's operations, you'll be able to help the entire Democratic Party work better.\n\nHowever, to be forthright:\n\n     * We've done a lot of budget hacking to get competitive when it comes to salaries. We know we can't beat Google, Facebook, and others, but we're not too far off.\n     * We're doing something aggressive. We know we are following a non-traditional path and are not in the private sector. We won't let this hold us back, but, there are different realities when it comes to fundraising and schedules (e.g. elections are immovable dates).\n     * We have a ton of legacy systems, and this is not a \"build everything from the ground up\" position. We need to take stock and plot a path forward given what we have.\n\nWhat we're looking for:\n\n     * We are currently looking for a Data Science Lead to join the D-Tech Data team. We need someone who can do feature selection in their sleep but also communicate well with non-technical audiences. You have high emotional intelligence, value elegant solutions, are pragmatic, and are a stickler for good documentation.

For doctors and hospitals, Doctolib is a software with a full-range of services dedicated to improve their day-to-day organization, develop their practice, build a premium patient experience and allow them to collaborate more easily with referring doctors.\n\n   We commit to deliver user friendly tools & services with the goal to improve people's health and quality of life of people working in healthcare. We are particularly focused on building an organisation where people thrive, grow in their careers, and enjoy having high impact through their work.\n\n   Doctolib in a nutshell (as of Sept.2017)\n   - We collaborate with 28,000 doctors and 750 healthcare facilities including some of the most important hospitals in France (AP-HP) and Germany.\n   - We gather 8.5 million patients on our platform each month with a significant growth\n   - We are 360 Doctolibers located in 35 offices (France and Germany) with our headquarter\n   in Paris.\n   - We have raised EUR50m from Accel Partners (investor in Facebook, Spotify, Dropbox...),\n   Bpifrance (Sigfox, Withings, Parrot) and some entrepreneurs (Nicolas Brusson (BlaBlaCar),\n   Pierre Kosciusko-Morizet (PriceMinister), Ludwig Klitzsch (CoMedicum), Bertrand\n   Jelensperger (TheFork)...).\n\n   Our technical team:\n   We have a team of 40 people. We will double the size of the team by the end of 2018. We are organized in squads and truly believe in development best practices (TDD, code review, pair programming, ...). Above all, we keep focus on being customer-centric, to daily bring high value to our customers.\n\n   Our stack is simple and sexy:\n   - Ruby on Rails 5.1 with Ruby 2.3\n   - PostgreSQL and Redis to stock millions of appointments and patients\n   - ReactJS/RxJS for the frontend\n   - Thousands of Capybara tests launched for each commit on Browserstack\n   - Chef to deploy on our private cloud\n   - An agile state of mind; we deploy every day in production\n\n   What you'll do:\n   - Set a product and technical direction with your team.\n   - Lead engineering team(s) to ship high quality software by a set deadline.\n   - Create, improve and drive operational excellence, quality, security and privacy initiatives across your teams and the entire engineering organisation.\n   - Contribute to your team's work on a daily basis to help and keep up to date on the code.

New managers are grown through our engineering team, so external leaders must have hands-on experience of people management.\n   - You care about agility as much you care for scalability and availability. Continuous deployment keeps us focused on incremental releases. Even our biggest technical achievements roll out piece by piece, feature flagged out of sight. Projects are kept short and tightly scoped. Teams build a weekly cadence of releases.\n   - You have deep knowledge of a web framework, but it does not need to be ruby on rails! Great people are effective and learn what we use quickly (or introduce us to better ways of working).\n   - You have already handled several large scale projects with multiple cross- team dependencies and interactions.\n   - You are pragmatic and have strong organizational skills.\n   - You are customer-centric, willing to daily  improve customer use.\n\n   Details:\n   - Contract: full-time position\n   - Start: as soon as possible\n   -

Eaze uses a sophisticated logistics and technology platform to provide a superior user experience through fast delivery of a broad variety of cannabis products across California.\n\n   If you choose to accept this mission, you will work with some of the most innovative growth, marketing, and product teams at any consumer product company in the Bay Area.  You will be a crucial part of the organization and drive massive consumer demand.\n\n   What you get out of it: a truly unique experience working in a revolutionary industry that is about to explode.  You will be a pioneer in scaling a product that is making its way into mass adoption.  If this sounds exciting (and challenging) to you, then read on!\n\nThe successful Growth Engineer will:\n\n     * Take big problems and solve them using engineering principles, programmatic/algorithmic solutions and a scrappy 80/20 approach\n     * Actually growth hack paid channels: A lot of the traditional digital advertising channels do not allow us to directly advertise our products on their platform but you will have to figure out how to do it (yes, it is doable)\n     * Know how to work with other people: this is a cross-functional role where you need to leverage the strengths of other groups to come up with clever solutions\n     * Combination of tactical and strategic: we will give you a problem, but we probably won't give you a roadmap.  It's up to you to make and execute.\n     * Figure stuff out:  we often work with APIs that we can exploit, which means they can be new and difficult\n     * Prioritize your work and manage deadlines. This is important.\n\nOur Ideal Candidate:\n\n     * Has a strong foundation in Python/Javascript, and concrete evidence that you have picked up a language quickly in the past.\n     * Is insanely data-driven and analytical. Our team members are the type of people who would optimize a landing page by using HotJar to see the how far people scroll down the page.\n     * Is an Excel/SQL wizard.  Be able to bridge the gap between spreadsheets and building lightweight tools.\n     * Can pick up code that was written by other authors and be able to dive in and debug.\n     * Has a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics, Computer Science, Engineering, or any technical major (in lieu of a degree, 2+ years of relevant work experience is acceptable).\n     * Must be available to work in our office in downtown San Francisco\n\n   About Eaze\n   Eaze (eaze.com) is the easiest, fastest, and most professional way to get medical marijuana delivered. Eaze has quickly become the #1 technology company in the fast-growing $6 billion cannabis industry by developing the first logistics technology and on-demand service that can help dispensaries to deliver to qualified patients in < 20 minutes.

cannabis technology company. Eaze uses a sophisticated logistics and technology platform to provide a superior user experience through fast delivery of a broad variety of cannabis products across California.\n\n   If you choose to accept this mission, you will work with some of the most innovative growth, marketing, and product teams at any consumer product company in the Bay Area.  You will be a crucial part of the organization and drive massive consumer demand.\n\n   What you get out of it: a truly unique experience working in a revolutionary industry that is about to explode.  You will be a pioneer in scaling a product that is making its way into mass adoption.  If this sounds exciting (and challenging) to you, then read on!\n\nThe successful Manager of Consumer Growth will:\n\n     * Actually growth hack paid channels: Most ad networks do not allow us to advertise our products on their platform but you need to figure out how (yes, it is doable)\n     * Find opportunities for organic or viral acquisition whether that is collaborating with our product team, leveraging our CRM, SEO, viral giveaways, etc.\n     * Automate your work wherever possible. We want your efforts to scale and for you to focus on problems that others can't solve.\n     * Successfully arbitrage LTV to CAC by optimizing the entire funnel, not just acquiring users.\n     * Roll up your sleeves and build. You will start with a team of zero, prove value, automate, and then expand if successful\n     * Disclaimer: this role is focused initially on paid acquisition but not limited to it.  If you are great at organic acquisition or influencer marketing, then we want you to scale that.\n\nOur Ideal Candidate:\n\n     * Is insanely data-driven and analytical. Our team members are the type of people who would optimize a job posting by using HotJar to see the how far people scroll down the page.\n     * Can speak to concrete experiences where they have gone deep on an acquisition channel--but have not become myopic in their thinking as a result of it.\n     * Is an Excel/SQL wizard.
