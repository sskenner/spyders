Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. - Jobs\n\n   Engineering at Crunchbase\n   Our Mission\n   It's nearly impossible to find an authoritative source of truth about companies that is both always up-to-date and freely available. Our mission is to continue building the largest high-quality, live, openly editable and accessible dataset of company and people information in the world -- and to build a delightful product with slick, easy-to-use APIs around that dataset.\n\n   We love building enjoyable user experiences, complex data schemata, APIs, and scalable systems that support tens of millions of interactions per day. Our team is a group of highly skilled engineers working on formidable problems throughout the stack.\n\n   How We Operate\n   We have a flexible model for team organization at Crunchbase, centered around the principles of agile software development, allowing us to fluidly adapt to new requirements and situations as they arise. We tend towards two main types of teams:\n\n   o Feature-oriented teams:operate independently and own their projects from cradle to grave, building everything they need to execute. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their responsibility to make sure the business needs are met all the way into production.\n   o Function-oriented teams: provide support to feature teams and have deeper expertise on particular parts of the stack. It's their responsibility to build platforms that are so good the other teams want to use them, rather than being forced into it.\n\n   We also ship code as early as we possibly can; getting betas into customer hands is a top priority. Our goal is to tune our process to customer needs as efficiently and quickly as possible. Crunchbase is built with a variety of tools - a core part of our engineering philosophy is to use the right tool for the job:\n   o Ruby, Scala, Java\n   o Node.js, Angular.js, Typescript\n   o Redis, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch\n   o Git, Nginx, Docker, NewRelic, Jenkins\n   o AWS - EC2, ELB, VPC, S3, R53, RDS, SQS, etc.\n\n   Frontend Engineering at Crunchbase\n   Crunchbase is more than just a dataset -- we're building a platform that enables companies and people to come together and reach one another regardless of where they are in the world.\n\n   User Interface and User Experience are the key drivers helping us to achieve this vision. We care deeply about creating something that feels right in every detail, and we're looking for engineers with either a solid design aesthetic or a passion for front-end componentry to help us go faster. The responsibilities of front-end engineers at Crunchbase include:\n   o Build single page web applications that are flexible, composable, metadata-driven, and able to rapidly adapt to new business requirements.\n   o Collaboratively drive user experience and design decisions with the product team to create interfaces our customers love.\n   o Create high-performance experiences that exceed both our perceived-perf and wall-clock-perf requirements.\n   o Maintain clean, fast, easy-to-understand CSS and component architectures.\n   o Implement best practices in frontend unit, functional and integration testing in a highly API-driven environment.\n\n   Qualifications\n   o Solid understanding of computer science and software engineering fundamentals.\n   o Motivated to participate in ongoing learning and growth through pair programming, code reviews, application of new technologies and best practices.\n   o Excellent verbal and written communication skills.\n   o Familiarity with tools we presently use is a plus, but not required -- if you know something better, we may use that instead!\n\n   What Crunchbase offers\n   o  Competitive salary and equity\n   o  A team of creative, transparent entrepreneurs driven to accomplish our mission\n   o  Daily catered lunches\n   o  Fitness reimbursement (to work off the catered lunches)\n   o  Unlimited Paid Time Off (PTO) -- we don't track vacation days\n   o  Incredible medical, vision, and dental benefits for employees and their families\n   o  401(k) and Roth plans, and free annual financial adviser check-in\n   o  Free One Medical Group membership for employees and their families\n   o  Commuting stipend\n   o  Free Lyft and Uber rides anywhere in the Bay Area after late nights at the office\n   o  Prime location in the Financial District of SF, near Bart Muni stops\n   o  Company and team offsites, retreats, events, and happy hours\n\n   Every day our team is honored to work with entrepreneurs and innovators from every corner of the globe, and we aim to build a team that reflects the diversity of our customers. Each individual at Crunchbase brings their own perspectives, work experiences, lifestyles, and cultures with them, and we believe that a more diverse team creates more innovative products, provides a better service to its customers, and helps us all grow and learn as individuals.

Our Software Engineers play a pivotal role in developing, improving, and scaling our online advertising technology platform. Our software is complex, massively scaled, and built with a wide variety of languages and tools, lending itself to the most exciting and challenging technical problems. We are currently hiring interns for the following engineering teams at AppNexus:\n\n   Real Time Platform\n   In 3 years, AppNexus grew from processing 300K QPS to over 5 million QPS for an approximate total of 100 billion requests per day. Engineers working on the real-time aspects of our platform optimize our software for performance, space, and algorithmic efficiency. This is a fast-paced, mission-critical environment - the software and systems being built drive our real-time bidding business along with a multitude of other core initiatives for AppNexus. We work under strict real-time constraints, responding to and executing real-time, dynamic auctions in less than 100 milliseconds.\n\n   DevOps\n   The DevOps team provides tools that enable easy, fast, and continuous evolution of the AppNexus platform. Developers working on the applications that make up the platform use DevOps' tools to release their changes into the production system. On a typical workday, multiple developers deploy their applications to production a total of 50 to 100 times. DevOps developers perform these deployments independently and their responsibility is to ensure the tools are available, perform well under high load, and are easy to use.\n\n   Optimization\n   At AppNexus, we process over 130 terabytes of data per day. This data is used to generate aggregated analytics reports, update budgets, and drive optimization engines. The Optimization team builds technology that identifies and analyzes relevant data to match buyers and sellers to help them achieve their business initiatives. To do this, engineers work closely with Data Scientists, implementing, testing and deploying complex models and intuitive, high-performance solutions for our diverse client base.\n\n   Full Stack\n   The Full Stack team builds powerful web applications that enable ad tech buyers and sellers to efficiently reach their audiences and monetize on our platform. User interfaces built by the team allow clients to easily control business objects and gain insight into performance. These applications are backed by robust back-end APIs which clients can integrate into directly, allowing them to drive results on our world-class real-time ad serving and bidding platform. In many cases, the products built by the Full Stack team are clients' first point of contact with the system, making the team's work critical to AppNexus' success.\n\n   Reliability\n   The Reliability team's mission is to ensure quality and reliability of the AppNexus platform. A reliable platform is what gives AppNexus the added flexibility and innovation velocity we need to compete at the top tier of the fast moving ad-tech industry. The Reliability team's engineers and analysts design and develop automated testing tests, tools, and processes.\n\n   Engineering Summer Intern, New York City\n\n   AppNexus is powering the advertising that powers the internet, and we're looking for awesome students to come spend the summer with us.

We believe in 10 years insurance will resemble asset management (real-time portfolio optimisation) and betting (closed systems with dynamic probabilities).\n\n   What you will be working on\n\n   You will be working on some of the company's biggest challenges, ranging from scaling our data processing pipelines (built using Python, Spark, ElasticSearch, Docker, GCP and TensorFlow/Keras) to building out our web crawling infrastructure (based on Python and JavaScript).\n\n   You will help to refine our development process, which already includes a well-maintained customer driven feature backlog, strong code review/testing processes and frequent continuous integration driven deploys of production features.\n\n   Solidifying your impact, you will also have the opportunity to work on exciting long-term high-value projects based on the latest research from the fields of AI and NLP, including work on our low latency event detection system that turns unstructured text streams into a structured dataset of real-world events.\n\n   What working as a Data Engineer at Cytora looks like\n\n   Your working days at Cytora begin with a stand up to synchronise efforts across the team, informed by weekly sprint planning with the whole company. In fortnightly one on ones with our CTO you will gain in-depth feedback on performance and map out areas for targeted near-term personal development.\n\n   We take pride in test driven development and peer reviewing colleagues' pull requests to ensure what we build is simple, elegant, reliable and self-documenting. Each week includes at least one opportunity for learning, typically in the form of a reading group with a presentation from somebody in your team. We regularly signal the end of the week with an all team breakfast.\n\n   What we are looking for in candidates\n\n   We look at the impact you have had working as a software engineer (internships or significant side projects count too) underpinned by a thorough education in computer science, either through self-study or a BSc or above. Another must is a drive to build effective technology solutions to solve significant problems.\n\n   Bonus points\n\n   We expect you to be able to pick up new technologies or concepts quickly.\n\n   We would be particularly impressed if you have had exposure to machine learning and natural language processing, but this is not a requirement.\n\n   We work in weekly sprints, so exposure to agile development methodologies (including test-driven development and continuous integration) would be a plus.\n\n   We use Docker/Kubernetes for continuous integration, so familiarity with concepts around containerisation would be useful. Finally, a lot of our infrastructure is in the form of scalable distributed systems, so experience with deploying/using clustered software and distributed systems is also a plus.\n\n   What we offer\n\n   You'll be offered a competitive salary and share options, augmented by our private health insurance.  To ensure continued professional development we offer exposure to world leading experts in multiple fields, including risk modelling, natural language processing/machine learning (our advisory board has two Cambridge professors and multiple industry experts).\n\n   Our conference budget allows us to network with our peers and present our work at industry and academic conferences.

In order to make the biggest impact you should have a broad and deep knowledge of machine learning techniques and practices that is clearly evident in the projects you've worked on previously. As well as technical experience with some of the core Python data science libraries (scikit-learn, Numpy/Scipy, pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter notebooks), you will also have data manipulation and data visualisation skills.\n\n   Bonus points\n\n   We expect you to be able to pick up new technologies or concepts quickly.\n\n   In addition, we would be particularly impressed if you have had exposure to production level engineering (including concepts like test-driven development and continuous integration,) but this is by no means a requirement.\n\n   We use Apache Spark for processing of multi-terabyte datasets, so familiarity with concepts around distributed computing and analysis would be useful.\n\n   What we offer\n\n   You'll be offered a competitive salary and share options, augmented by our private health insurance.  To ensure continued professional development we offer exposure to world leading experts in multiple fields, including risk modelling, natural language processing/machine learning (our advisory board has two Cambridge professors and multiple industry experts).\n\n   Our conference budget allows us to network with our peers and present our work at industry and academic conferences. These learning opportunities continue through internal knowledge-sharing activities, such as our AI reading group, study sessions and regular talks across the team.\n\n   Besides the constant learning opportunities, Cytora is a great place to form new friendships and be exposed to diverse experiences.
