Research shows that a significant number of people decide not to apply to jobs based on the requirements listed in the ad; if you see something here that you're interested in but not expert level at...good! You can learn here. It's also best that you aren't brilliant at everything, as we don't hire ninjas, wizards, or padawans. Other than those, we're very inclusive. If you think Deliveroo could be a great place for you, apply!\n\n   We'd love you to join us!\n\n   Hello, we're Deliveroo. The Roo logo on the bikes? Yep, that's us! We're one of the world's fastest growing startups, and we're making huge waves in the restaurant and logistics industries.\n\n   Contrary to popular belief, it's not kangaroo meat in the boxes. It's quality food from top-notch restaurants like Cocotte, Gaucho, or Busaba. Instead of your local takeaway, we'll fill your mealtime with the best cuisine, cooked by the best chefs from around the world.\n\n   What we do\n   We bring meals of the highest quality, from the restaurant to you, fast. Try it out if you haven't before. Go to our website or open up our mobile app. You'll be greeted by an elegant menu, put together by our talented product team. Once you've input your location, we'll provide a curated list of restaurants that will deliver to you. Select your items, choose any modifiers (lemon and herb? Oh, come on!) and we'll take over. Swap the sloppy joe for a gourmet burger just dripping with all sorts of deliciousness.\n\n   How it works\n   Our brilliant team have helped us build a fantastically complex system that alerts the restaurant to your order, and sends a Roo (that's what we call them, the lovely people on scooters and bikes) to the restaurant, and then to your location, in an average time of 32 minutes. It's great for all occasions: a business lunch, entertaining guests (or guest...we won't tell them you didn't make it yourself!), or any time where a dodgy smelling leftover kebab just won't cut it!\n\nYour impact\n\n     * You'll work in a feature driven product team, working closely with Backend & Mobile Developers, Product Designers, Product Managers and QAs, owning a product and being responsible for its success. Whether it's creating an interface to monitor delivery metrics, or one to increase conversion on the consumer website, you'll be making an incredible contribution to our success\n     * You'll solve real world problems. We're revolutionising the logistics and food industries, making poor quality takeaways a thing of the past. The stuff that goes on in the product team has allowed us to reign supreme in the world of food delivery, and you'll be adding to that\n     * You'll learn from the very best. Our management team is made up of the cr\ufffdme de la cr\ufffdme from successful companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Hotels.com. Our developers are of the highest calibre, and you can learn more about them by visiting our Engineering Blog\n     * You'll teach us! Product huddles every two weeks are where you get a chance to show off personal projects, present on a new technology you've become a big fan of, or practice a talk you're planning to present at an upcoming event\n\n   The Lever Story\n\n   Lever builds software for teams to source, interview, and hire top talent.

Our team strives to set a new bar for enterprise software with modern, well-designed, real-time apps. We participated in Y Combinator in summer 2012, and since then have raised $40 million. This year, we're doubling the team in size, and we're looking forward to supporting more great companies like Netflix, Eventbrite, and Lyft. Interested in learning more? Take an inside look at Lever!\n\n   Lever is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce.\n\n   Lever is a design-driven company and as our Product Designer, you'll lead the way. You'll be at the forefront of our product team, sprinting ahead of the rest to determine what we need to work on, define what our solution will be, and participate in the end-to-end process to make it real.\n\n   You should be ready to employ a wide range of methodologies, strategies, and tools to solve design challenges across the board. Lever's current design team prides itself on being \"full-stack generalists,\" with the ability to solve problems with a blend of human-centered and technical approaches. We take users quite seriously and spend a lot of time directly interacting with users doing on-site research to both spec and evaluate features. And we're as closely integrated with engineering as you'd expect at an early stage, fast-moving startup. It would be a good sign if you're interested in learning to code, or already consider yourself pretty handy on the front-end.\n\n   The constraints you'll be considering cover a huge surface area, including: multiple user groups, varying company size, limited development resources, and engineering complexity. As such, you'll be working closely with Business, Customer Success, Product, and Engineering teams and communicating with them to make holistic decisions. Communication is a big part of your job, perhaps the most crucial value you'll add to shaping Lever. Design's recommendation carries huge weight in our team; you'll be empowered to make Lever into an exemplary app that people love to use.\n\n   To-date, we've focused on bringing collaboration to Lever through design principles like these:\n   - Create shared workspaces to share goals\n   - Design for humans, not data entry\n   - Drive action with transparency\n\nWithin 3 months, you'll\n\n     * Deeply understand our users, the problem, and the space\n     * Know every corner of our app and identified issues/opportunities ripe for design improvements\n     * Visit customers/users and translate your learnings into communication materials to share with the rest of the team\n     * Design features and see them go live\n\nWithin 6 months, you'll\n\n     * Lead the planning and design of complex a feature and take it from concept to deployment\n     * Be working independently with engineers and product to take features from zero to deployed\n     * Contribute to our codebase at a level appropriate to your appetite\n\nWithin 12 months, you'll\n\n     * Lead the design strategy for major, new company initiatives\n     * Hire and mentor other designers\n\n   The Lever Story:\n\n   Lever builds software for teams to source, interview, and hire top talent.

Lever's hiring platform helps companies hire better by bringing more engagement, transparency, and collaboration to hiring. We're setting out to change the way people grow organizations.\n\n   Lever is seeking a strategic decision maker to help us set, drive, and execute our product roadmap. You'll work closely with founders to set priorities and make key strategic decisions. You'll touch every part of our company to integrate needs, demands, and requirements and transform that into material impact. And ultimately, we'll look to you to help us define and measure our success.\n\n   Our team is tackling the #1 challenge for every founder/CEO, one which only grows over time: hiring. Hiring top talent is the ultimate strategic advantage that defines a startup's success or failure. But the tools and processes have been isolated in HR, where they have grown stale, ineffective, and vulnerable to disruption. Where other tools focus on workflow automation, we're making the hiring process more human to make it more effective. Lever's customers include Box, Quora, Lyft, Coursera, Foursquare, Slack, Reddit, and GitHub.\n\nWITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL...\n\n     * Deeply understand our users, our competitive landscape, our go-to-market strategy\n     * Own our feature priority list\n     * Drive initiatives forward and make key decisions on planning, scope, budgeting\n     * Define our core product metrics, set up tracking for them, and regularly report out to the rest of the team\n\nWITHIN 6 MONTHS, YOU'LL...\n\n     * Lead project documentation\n     * Scope accurate timeline and launch targets\n     * Contribute big ideas to meet our goals and spec them into targeted initiatives\n     * Be a key participant in company-wide strategic planning of quarterly objectives\n\nWITHIN 12 MONTHS, YOU'LL...\n\n     * Be spearheading efforts on an entire new product space and strategy\n     * Be mentoring or managing a team around our core product\n\n   Your strengths in cross-functional communication will be key. You should feel as comfortable digging into technical issues with engineers as you are collaborating with a VP of Sales. Product sits at the intersection of all of Lever's core functions - engineering, design, onboarding, support, sales, and marketing - and you'll be interacting with colleagues from all teams, all levels. As Lever goes through a hyper-growth period in the next year, you'll be a critical force in evangelizing the product vision to new teammates. Deep passion for product is a must.\n\n   We hope you see yourself founding your own company someday, because we're looking for someone with that level of talent and ambition. You'll be tasked with responsibilities across the full 360 of startup life: everything from sales considerations, scaling challenges, to fundraising strategy. And if/when you may make your next move, this opportunity will have given you front-row seats to scaling all aspects of a company - tech, team, revenue. You'll have contributed to the key decisions at every turn.\n\n   About Lever\n\n   Our team is tackling the #1 challenge for every founder/CEO, one which only grows over time: hiring.
