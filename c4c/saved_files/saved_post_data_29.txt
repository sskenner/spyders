You need to care about the users and think beyond just the technical challenges.\n     * Self directed: We're a startup. We need someone who is comfortable taking an imperfect feature specification and driving it all the way to completion.\n     * Good judgment: Ability to build secure and reliable systems and handle sensitive customer data.\n\n   About Us:\n\n   HelloSign is creating the next generation eSignature platform, with a focus on clean usability.

We are looking for solutions engineers who can combine a deep connection with Kubernetes, and with customers (both technical staff, and executive decisions makers).\n\n   We are looking for engineers that want to do everything from running POC engagements, to architecting solutions, to designing and integrating existing systems, to writing code that solves customer problems or improves the open source project.\n\n   WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING...\n   Spend time with users and the community to develop a deep understanding of Kubernetes, identifying challenges developers and operators encounter when building and running clusters.\n   Work with customers to understand their business needs, technical architecture and provide consulting services to help them modernize their IT systems and processes.\n   Understand and evangelize the value of cloud native computing practices in the community, at conferences and through social media, not only technically but also from an organization and operations perspective.\n   Develop an ability to diagnose the best prescription for a given customer situation, and the ability to influence sponsors and champions to head down the right path. Occasionally teach our Heptio University training curriculum.\n   Help Heptio gather invaluable insight into the state of the marketplace, the challenges that our customers are facing, and the key features and capabilities that we can offer to make the adoption of Kubernetes more delightful.\n\n   YOUR QUALIFICATIONS...\n   You have a track record of managing successful distributed systems projects as an engineer of enterprise technologies.\n   You have strong technical architecture skills that you can leverage to drive organizational and operational transformation.\n   You have a passion for helping others, and the right bed side manner to operate in a variety of environments, corporate cultures, and technology stacks.\n   You understand what it means to be a rebel or pioneer within an IT department, and you have honed your skills at getting others to follow.\n   You are highly technical and have worked in a software development role in the past, or have equivalent skills.\n   You are comfortable with basic code exercises.You are comfortable engaging with executives to understand the business goals, and with engineering teams to understand technical implications. You can credibly speak to both.\n   You have a track record leading engagements with small teams and are comfortable managing either directly or through dotted line relationships.\n   You are willing to travel up to 50% of the time.\n\n   IT WOULD BE NICE IF...\n   You've worked on or with other technologies that make up the new \"cloud native\" stack.  This would include Docker, Mesosphere, Go.\n   You have managed an OpenStack practice, or have other experience working with an open source community.\n\n   Important: we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
