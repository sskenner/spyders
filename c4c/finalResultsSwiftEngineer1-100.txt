But now, there's a team of engineers, marketers, and business builders actually making headway on this problem. With more than 1,000,000 carpool trips taken in our first 2 years, Scoop is the largest carpooling platform in the United States. The Scoop team has made carpooling easy for the first time - and we are looking for awesome developers to help us continue the fight against traffic. Maybe it's you? The Scoop team has a simple mission: to eliminate traffic and reimagine transportation, giving life back to commuters and communities. Two years after our San Francisco Bay Area launch, Scoop has become a vibrant community of coworkers and neighbors across the Bay and, more recently, Seattle. Our mobile-first commuting technology powers the carpooling programs of many of the Bay Area and Seattle's largest employers, including Cisco, Tesla, Workday, and Salesforce.",

But now, there's a team of engineers, marketers, and business builders actually making headway on this problem. With more than 1,000,000 carpool trips taken in our first 2 years, Scoop is the largest carpooling platform in the United States. The Scoop team has made carpooling easy for the first time - and we are looking for awesome developers to help us continue the fight against traffic. Maybe it's you? The Scoop team has a simple mission: to eliminate traffic and reimagine transportation, giving life back to commuters and communities. Two years after our San Francisco Bay Area launch, Scoop has become a vibrant community of coworkers and neighbors across the Bay and, more recently, Seattle. Our mobile-first commuting technology powers the carpooling programs of many of the Bay Area and Seattle's largest employers, including Cisco, Tesla, Workday, and Salesforce.",
