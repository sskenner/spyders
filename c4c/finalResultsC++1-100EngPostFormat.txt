This year we are launching a platform that will allow developers globally to find projects and teams based on their code. We are very excited about what\'s to come and have summarised everything on our blog if you want to read further, you can see at this blog post where all this comes from and read our roadmap.\n\n   We have raised a $6M round last Summer and are rapidly growing our team.\n\n   TEAM\n\n   At the moment, the engineering team consists of four different teams: Data Retrieval (Go and Scala), Platform (Go and JavaScript), Data Science (C++ and Python) and Infrastructure (Go and Python).\n\n   Our infrastructure is built on bare metal servers, with Kubernetes and CoreOS, and stores over +17M git repositories.\n\n   We believe in continuously giving everyone the chance to learn and develop professionally and in building a cohesive team that welcomes every new person. We have monthly get togethers, annual hackathon retreats and regularly attend conferences all over Europe (dotGo, FOSDEM, ReactEurope, etc.)\n\n   ROLE\n\n   The Data Retrieval team is focused on building our data pipeline which allows the other teams to consume the information extracted from the git repositories efficiently. The synchronization and manipulation of more than +17M git repositories is done in Go, using our own git implementation (go-git). The pipeline which is being developed, plans to manage more than 1PB of information using a mix of Scala and Go on top of Spark, HDFS and Parquet. One of our current challenges, for instance, is to extract the AST over billions of files in hundreds of languages.\n\n   At source{d}, we really care about open source, you can easily check a couple of our Data Retrieval team\'s projects below:\n   o  go-git: A low level and highly extensible Git implementation in pure Go.\n   o  siva: seekable indexed block archiver format\n   o  go-billy: the missing interface to abstract several storages.\n\n   If you are interested on how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.\n\n   Good knowledge of distributed computing and parallel processing is important. You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages and very good algorithmic skills. Go is not a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team\'s mindset and prior experience than any specific skills.\n\n   At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from EUR49.000 to EUR53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).\n\n   CULTURE\n\n   source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what\'s best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.\n\n   "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don\'t hire anyone who doesn\'t fit into this culture, it\'s the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.\n\n   At the moment, we\'re 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from the office in Madrid. Although we\'re looking to grow our team in-house at the moment and not accepting remote, we are willing to sponsor your visa if needed and our team is used to helping people relocate to Madrid. We offer support throughout the entire process to you and your family\n\n   Apply for this job\n', 'utc_datetime': '2017-09-01T12:35:33.313371', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

This year we are launching a platform that will allow developers globally to find projects and teams based on their code. We are very excited about what\'s to come and have summarised everything on our blog if you want to read further, you can see at this blog post where all this comes from and read our roadmap.\n\n   We have raised a $6M round last Summer and are rapidly growing our team.\n\n   TEAM\n\n   The Data Science team is focused on providing intelligent insights into nearly all the world\'s open source code. This includes typical big data analysis as well as solving sophisticated Machine Learning problems. The former is conducted on Apache Spark clusters with up to 1,000 nodes, the latter leverage extensive GPGPU acceleration on the custom hardware and Deep Learning techniques, standing on top of source{d}\'s original open source projects and Tensorflow. Often, arising ML problems are unsupervised and require much research in the unusual\n   domain of source code ML.\n\n   source{d} tries to be as open in it\'s ongoing research as possible. If a handy developed tool can be open-sourced then it has to be. If a solved interesting problem can be disclosed, it has to be published in source{d}\'s blog. If a funny dataset is compiled, it is published on data.world.\n\n   To this moment, source{d}\'s engineers have developed:\n\n   o  kmcuda - lightning fast K-means and K-nearest neighbours on NVIDIA GPUs. It allows us to cluster 3 million samples, each 256 dimensions, into 1000 clusters in less than 20 minutes with the outstanding precision using two NVIDIA Titan X cards.\n   o  minhashcuda - lightning fast Weighted MinHash on NVIDIA GPUs. This tool allowed us to scan all +17M git repositories in 30 minutes and find 1.5M duplicates (the results were\n   published on data.world.\n   o  lapjv - Jonker-Volgenant algorithm to solve linear sum assignment problems, accelerated with Intel AVX2 instruction set. It is capable of transforming 4096 t-SNE dots into 64x64 images in 2 minutes.\n   o  hercules - Git repositories line burn down analysis command line tool built on top of source{d}\'s go-git - Git client and server implementation in pure Go language.\n   o  sparkpickle - the tool to read PySpar RDD files without having to install Spark.\n\n   ...the following notable data science posts and talks exist:\n\n   o  397 Languages, 18,000,000 GitHub repositories, 1.2 billion files, 20 terabytes of code: Spaces or Tabs\n   o  Topic Modeling of GitHub Repositories\n   o  Hands on with the most starred GitHub repositories\n   o  Source code abstracts classification using CNN\n\n   ...the following datasets published:\n   o  Names in source code extracted from 13 000 000 GitHub repositories. Not people! 30GB\n   o  October 2016 GitHub repositories not marked as forks but very similar to each other\n   o  Readme files found in all GitHub repositories (16M, October 2016\n   o  ~= 452,000,000 commits\' metadata taken from 16,000,000 repositories on GitHub (Oct 2016)\n\n   ROLE\n\n   Strong computer science and machine learning background is essential for data science team members. You will be expected to be a passionate, skilful engineer who is able to produce amazing results quickly and reliably. Coding skills are important; we are using Python 3 in our research and production prototyping. Besides, we occasionally code in Go, C++ and CUDA.\n\n   CULTURE\n\n   source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what\'s best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.\n\n   "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don\'t hire anyone who doesn\'t fit into this culture, it\'s the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.\n\n   At the moment, we\'re 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from the office in Madrid. Although we\'re looking to grow our team in-house at the moment and not accepting remote, we are willing to sponsor your visa if needed and our team is used to helping people relocate to Madrid.
