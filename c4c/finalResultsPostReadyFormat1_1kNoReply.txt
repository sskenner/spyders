AtScale aims to make it fast and easy to access all your data.\n\n   AtScale is fundamentally an engineering company. AtScale solves unanswered questions every day, and therefore hires people from a multitude of technical backgrounds who can think creatively and handle some of the most challenging problems facing the modern big data landscape.

Engineers are given tremendous autonomy and authority over their work. We value throughput over predictability.

Our engineers have the opportunity to work directly with our customers, which we believe equips them with the best possible understanding of our customer\'s needs.\n\n   In both our product and our culture, we aim to create a more open, connected and knowledgable world.\n\n   Apply for this job\n', 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T03:40:36.074053', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.\n\nHow do I know if I have a disability?\n\n   You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

Please tell us if you require a reasonable accommodation to apply for a job or to perform your job. Examples of reasonable accommodation include making a change to the application process or work procedures, providing documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using specialized equipment.\n\n   Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.\n\n   If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way.

Well, FiscalNote front-end engineers are the architects that make our open data dreams come true. Wild ambition isn\'t lacking at FiscalNote, and only the most talented can visualize open-data products that have never been built before. Our front-end engineers love what they do, and they are on a mission to continuously improve upon and build the most beautiful and useful user interfaces the open data world has ever seen.\n\n   About You\n   Creative. Ambitious. Communicative. Driven. You yearn to exercise your abilities in a greater capacity than on a tiny feature of a much larger product. Lending your talents across our entire stack, you not only love sharing your savvy with the team, but also crave the opportunity to absorb any and all knowledge from our hyper-collaborative environment. Your appreciation (bordering on obsession) for clean code and attention to detail have helped you shine brightly at previous positions. You\'re tickled by the idea of implementing inventive uses of older technologies, but even more revved at the idea of leveraging the most modern front-end tools, frameworks, and languages. Most of all, though, you live to engineer creative interfaces that take the user experience to a whole new level.\n\n   You Have\n   - 2+ years of industry experience programming in JavaScript\n   - Expertise with HTML5 and CSS3\n   - Expertise with jQuery\n   - Knowledge of algorithms, data structures and Object Oriented programming\n   - Knowledge of and experience with JavaScript MV* frameworks. Ember.js is highly recommended.\n   - Undergraduate and/or graduate degree in engineering, computer science, or related technical field (Preferred)\n   - Proficient with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or related design software (Preferred)\n   - UI/UX design experience (Ideal)\n\n   About Engineering at FiscalNote\n   Our team has a wealth of diverse life and career experiences that allow us to think outside of the box and ahead of the curve. And we laugh - all the time. You\'ll get the opportunity to work at an institution pushing the boundaries of open data transparency, while collaborating with some of the industry\'s brightest engineers and data scientists to devise, nurture, and implement cutting-edge solutions to continuously evolving engineering obstacles.\n\n   In becoming a FiscalNoter, you\'ll enjoy a plethora of benefits that you would expect at both an established company and at a startup. More importantly, though, is the opportunity to develop software that impacts real decisions -- decisions that substantially affect governing in the US and abroad. You will hone your engineering skills among peers just as motivated and skilled as you are, and in the process, develop a tight-knit camaraderie that will transcend simple software development.\n   Apply for this job\n', 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T03:41:31.247557', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

We're changing that by building tools that automate the mundane tasks around collaboration, planning and version control (think version control for blueprints). Our users are building some of the most amazing construction projects in the world, and our platform is their central information point.\n\n   As a Windows Engineer, you will tackle some very difficult and interesting challenges.  Things like:\n   - Building near real-time collaboration and markup for construction drawings\n   - Building slick and responsive UI that can handle millions of user generated data points (like photos and annotations)\n   - Replacing Excel workflows with simple, powerful tools that work great on mobile devices (both phones and tablets)\n   - Build unique user experiences for large scale displays (Surface Hub)\n   - Integrating with existing construction software in ways that will remove the tedious from our users daily jobs and let them focus on building incredible building on time and on budget!\n   - Working at PlanGrid means that you will be supported doing really great work, using technologies you like, alongside peers that you respect. You'll be doing it on a product that delights users and has had exponential revenue growth from the day it launched. If that sounds like the environment for you, we'd love for you to build and grow with us.\n\n   About our Tech Stack:\n   We are building a desktop application in C# (we use the latest version) using WPF because we need to support the user which are running on Windows 7. Aside from this support our main focus will be to use `Project Centennial' from Microsoft to allow our WPF application to run from a universal container and be distributed via the Store on Windows 10.\n   Core technologies we use (there are many others that we use as well) are:\n   - SQL LocalDB + Entity Framework + Dapper + tuned custom SQL to store our data.\n   - ReactiveExtensions + ReactiveUI for responsive UI.\n   - Newtonsoft, JSON for fast and easy JSON parsing.\n   - WIX + MSI for our installer technology.\n\n   However, you will also be expected to work with other teams, not just Windows, and their stack is extremely diverse so you will get exposure to lots of technologies including, but not limited to, Python, PostgreSQL, Mongo, iOS, and Android.\n\n   About You:\n   - At least 3 years of .NET/C# experience or 5+ years of Win32 C++ experience\n   - Experience with WPF or XAML is a plus\n   - Experience with Entity Framework is a plus\n   - Experience with Reactive Extensions is a plus\n   - Have the passion and dedication to write highly performant and reliable code\n   - Love solving tricky problems\n   - Team player - you love to teach others about cool new tricks you learned and absorb tips and tricks from developers; love solving problems as a team across platforms\n   - You're excited to join a team that is smart, quirky & genuinely excited about the magic going on at PlanGrid\n\n   About PlanGrid:\n   PlanGrid solves a major problem for a 7,000 year old industry. Construction data is shackled in legacy, paper blueprints that are clunky, heavy to carry, and result in enormous rework costs totaling $9 billion per year for the industry due to working from outdated plans.\n\n   PlanGrid was built by builders, for builders. We're spearheading the industry's transformation to the cloud and digitization by arming construction workers with the best productivity tools.

This year we are launching a platform that will allow developers globally to find projects and teams based on their code. We are very excited about what\'s to come and have summarised everything on our blog if you want to read further, you can see at this blog post where all this comes from and read our roadmap.\n\n   We have raised a $6M round last Summer and are rapidly growing our team.\n\n   TEAM\n\n   At the moment, the engineering team consists of four different teams: Data Retrieval (Go and Scala), Platform (Go and JavaScript), Data Science (C++ and Python) and Infrastructure (Go and Python).\n\n   Our infrastructure is built on bare metal servers, with Kubernetes and CoreOS, and stores over +17M git repositories.\n\n   We believe in continuously giving everyone the chance to learn and develop professionally and in building a cohesive team that welcomes every new person. We have monthly get togethers, annual hackathon retreats and regularly attend conferences all over Europe (dotGo, FOSDEM, ReactEurope, etc.)\n\n   ROLE\n\n   The Data Retrieval team is focused on building our data pipeline which allows the other teams to consume the information extracted from the git repositories efficiently. The synchronization and manipulation of more than +17M git repositories is done in Go, using our own git implementation (go-git). The pipeline which is being developed, plans to manage more than 1PB of information using a mix of Scala and Go on top of Spark, HDFS and Parquet. One of our current challenges, for instance, is to extract the AST over billions of files in hundreds of languages.\n\n   At source{d}, we really care about open source, you can easily check a couple of our Data Retrieval team\'s projects below:\n   o  go-git: A low level and highly extensible Git implementation in pure Go.\n   o  siva: seekable indexed block archiver format\n   o  go-billy: the missing interface to abstract several storages.\n\n   If you are interested on how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.\n\n   Good knowledge of distributed computing and parallel processing is important. You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages and very good algorithmic skills. Go is not a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team\'s mindset and prior experience than any specific skills.\n\n   At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from EUR49.000 to EUR53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).\n\n   CULTURE\n\n   source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what\'s best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.\n\n   "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don\'t hire anyone who doesn\'t fit into this culture, it\'s the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.\n\n   At the moment, we\'re 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from the office in Madrid. Although we\'re looking to grow our team in-house at the moment and not accepting remote, we are willing to sponsor your visa if needed and our team is used to helping people relocate to Madrid.

We are focused on building software that brings additional value to Cratejoy by delivering high quality, incremental solutions regularly. As a Senior Software Engineer, you will be responsible for working with the product team, building tools on our platform to provide a world-class user experience, make it highly scalable and extremely reliable.\n\n   We are passionate about our product and that means thinking about how you would want an API to work if you were using it, then making it clear and easy for someone who\'s never heard of the term API.  We\'ve got a strong product team to help support this, but we expect senior people to be polyglots, unafraid of jumping on hard problems, doing the dirty work, making sense of them, and helping craft the solution, not just the implementation.\n\n   We are looking for people to be good at their job and help elevate the team around them.  We care deeply about career growth and we want people that will also help grow us.\n\n   This is that dream role at a start-up you\'ve been looking for - all the passion and growth, lots of up-side but without having to eat ramen 3 meals a day. This isn\'t a photo sharing app - people are quitting their jobs and realizing their dreams on Cratejoy.

They specifically have sought out Cratejoy, they understand what our company does and they feel some sort of affinity with the mission. They are hungry for knowledge and are looking to be challenged in new ways, perhaps they even aspire to start their own business one day - or maybe they already have and now they want to know how to start a high impact business next time. They obviously care about compensation but they aren\'t just looking for the next higher title and a little pay bump from their current job. They are leaving their current company after making some sort of impact, rather than because they just seem to leave jobs every 18 months once they realize it wasn\'t as exciting as they thought it would be.\n\n   They seem to be aware of who they are as a person, including their own weaknesses, and want the sort of direct feedback and coaching it takes to grow their skillset, into a better team member, and even into a better person. In general people they worked with in the past would say that they are the type of person that "seems to make everything a little bit better" and that adding them to any conversation made the conversation more interesting, rather than more frustrating.\n\n   They respect their peers and want to learn more from those around them, and they give people the benefit of the doubt. They don\'t rush to condemn people and they don\'t quietly judge, they seek to help their peers be their best. They don\'t like to assign blame, but if they were to assign blame they\'d be just as likely to assign it to themselves as anyone else.\n\n   They are hard working when they have a mission, but they aren\'t just aimlessly working tons of hours for no particular reason. They care a lot about what it is that they are doing, and they don\'t just blindly follow direction. They want and need to understand how their work connects with the mission of the company and once they do they take it on as their own mission in life. When looking to solve problems they are willing to go outside themselves, but only after doing the diligence necessary. They don\'t like to waste anyone\'s time - least of all their own.\n   They are quick to admit mistakes, and they don\'t let ego leave them on the wrong side of an issue for very long (or very often). In their area of primary skillset they are very strong in it. They may have other weaknesses, which is okay as long as they are aware of them, but there is at least one or two things at which they are indisputably A+.\n\n   About Cratejoy\n\n   Cratejoy is the one-stop destination for all things subscription box. Where you subscribe to what you love, and sell what you\'re passionate about.\n\n   We\'re a Y Combinator and Capital Factory company and have raised a series A from CRV in California. We\'re very well funded and have been growing at a staggering rate every single month since launch. Cratejoy\'s growth is rocket ship fast, and we\'d love for you to be a big part of it.\n\n   Our aim is to make subscription as accessible as eBay or Etsy make ecommerce today. Our vision is to bring the best business model in the universe to everyone on the planet.\n\n   There\'s 3 pieces to that vision:\n\n   The first was our subscription commerce platform. Our seller tools. There was no consensus for how to run a subscription business. We had to design those tools and build them. We had to do it in a way that is accessible to average online merchant. If they were savvy enough to run an etsy store they should be more than savvy enough to run a cratejoy subscription.\n\n   The next piece was education. There really were no resources that taught merchants how to run a subscription business. We built subscription school which is a free education site we run. Our team has deep subscription commerce expertise. We write articles, post videos and host webinars to teach people how to run subscription businesses. We created a forum which puts merchants in an community where they support each other and learn together. In the space of a year we\'ve become the unrivaled thought leaders inside of subscription commerce.\n\n   Finally, we\'ve built the marketplace. This is a consumer destination site that sells subscriptions. Consumers arrive at Cratejoy and subscribe to our merchants. We cross-sell additional subscriptions to them. This is the piece that we wanted to get to. By creating the platform we were aggregating supply for the marketplace. The marketplace is the demand side of the equation. And the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts, these all tie back together to build the virtuous cycle that is the Cratejoy ecosystem.\n\n   FAQ\n\n   How much have you raised? $11M in VC from the best investors in the world\n\n   Do you have revenue?

This year we are launching a platform that will allow developers globally to find projects and teams based on their code. We are very excited about what\'s to come and have summarised everything on our blog if you want to read further, you can see at this blog post where all this comes from and read our roadmap.\n\n   We have raised a $6M round last Summer and are rapidly growing our team.\n\n   TEAM\n\n   At the moment, the engineering team consists of four different teams: Data Retrieval (Go and Scala), Platform (Go and JavaScript), Data Science (C++ and Python) and Infrastructure (Go and Python).\n\n   Our infrastructure is built on bare metal servers, with Kubernetes and CoreOS, and stores over +17M git repositories.\n\n   We believe in continuously giving everyone the chance to learn and develop professionally and in building a cohesive team that welcomes every new person. We have monthly get togethers, annual hackathon retreats and regularly attend conferences all over Europe (dotGo, FOSDEM, ReactEurope, etc.)\n\n   ROLE\n\n   The Data Retrieval team is focused on building our data pipeline which allows the other teams to consume the information extracted from the git repositories efficiently. The synchronization and manipulation of more than +17M git repositories is done in Go, using our own git implementation (go-git). The pipeline which is being developed, plans to manage more than 1PB of information using a mix of Scala and Go on top of Spark, HDFS and Parquet. One of our current challenges, for instance, is to extract the AST over billions of files in hundreds of languages.\n\n   At source{d}, we really care about open source, you can easily check a couple of our Data Retrieval team\'s projects below:\n   o  go-git: A low level and highly extensible Git implementation in pure Go.\n   o  siva: seekable indexed block archiver format\n   o  go-billy: the missing interface to abstract several storages.\n\n   If you are interested on how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.\n\n   Good knowledge of distributed computing and parallel processing is important. You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages and very good algorithmic skills. Go is not a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team\'s mindset and prior experience than any specific skills.\n\n   At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from EUR49.000 to EUR53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).\n\n   CULTURE\n\n   source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what\'s best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.\n\n   "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don\'t hire anyone who doesn\'t fit into this culture, it\'s the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.\n\n   At the moment, we\'re 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from the office in Madrid. Although we\'re looking to grow our team in-house at the moment and not accepting remote, we are willing to sponsor your visa if needed and our team is used to helping people relocate to Madrid. We offer support throughout the entire process to you and your family\n\n   Apply for this job\n', 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T04:08:56.426146', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

This year we are launching a platform that will allow developers globally to find projects and teams based on their code. We are very excited about what\'s to come and have summarised everything on our blog if you want to read further, you can see at this blog post where all this comes from and read our roadmap.\n\n   We have raised a $6M round last Summer and are rapidly growing our team.\n\n   TEAM\n\n   At the moment, the engineering team consists of four different teams: Data Retrieval (Go and Scala), Platform (Go and JavaScript), Data Science (C++ and Python) and Infrastructure (Go and Python).\n\n   Our infrastructure is built on bare metal servers, with Kubernetes and CoreOS, and stores over +17M git repositories.\n\n   We believe in continuously giving everyone the chance to learn and develop professionally and in building a cohesive team that welcomes every new person. We have monthly get togethers, annual hackathon retreats and regularly attend conferences all over Europe (dotGo, FOSDEM, ReactEurope, etc.)\n\n   ROLE\n\n   The Data Retrieval team is focused on building our data pipeline which allows the other teams to consume the information extracted from the git repositories efficiently. The synchronization and manipulation of more than +17M git repositories is done in Go, using our own git implementation (go-git). The pipeline which is being developed, plans to manage more than 1PB of information using a mix of Scala and Go on top of Spark, HDFS and Parquet. One of our current challenges, for instance, is to extract the AST over billions of files in hundreds of languages.\n\n   At source{d}, we really care about open source, you can easily check a couple of our Data Retrieval team\'s projects below:\n   o  go-git: A low level and highly extensible Git implementation in pure Go.\n   o  siva: seekable indexed block archiver format\n   o  go-billy: the missing interface to abstract several storages.\n\n   If you are interested on how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.\n\n   Good knowledge of distributed computing and parallel processing is important. You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages and very good algorithmic skills. Go is not a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team\'s mindset and prior experience than any specific skills.\n\n   At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from EUR49.000 to EUR53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).\n\n   CULTURE\n\n   source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what\'s best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.\n\n   "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don\'t hire anyone who doesn\'t fit into this culture, it\'s the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.\n\n   At the moment, we\'re 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from the office in Madrid. Although we\'re looking to grow our team in-house at the moment and not accepting remote, we are willing to sponsor your visa if needed and our team is used to helping people relocate to Madrid. We offer support throughout the entire process to you and your family\n\n   Apply for this job\n', 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T04:11:41.293770', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

We run projects in more than 20 countries across the globe, with the aim to simplify and optimize naturally complex processes in order to create a seamless society. Here is what we have done:\n   -We\'ve propelled Oman 127 places up in World Bank ranking for Ease of Doing Business by changing local legislation and creating an e-Business Registry, to boost local business setup.\n   -We\'ve created meaningful impact for 35 million telecom subscribers across Baltics and Nordics and parts of Asia alongside key telco operators, and tens of millions across United States alongside one of the leading telecom players.\n   -We are awarded as most employee and family-friendly company in Estonia in 2008, 2012 & 2014\n\n   The project leverages Elastic Path Commerce built with widely used Java open source technologies including Spring, OpenJPA, Solr, Drools and Camel.

In US e-commerce projects we use Elastic Path Commerce to build a single coherent API to simplify and improve the customer journey for 100 million end users.\n   Architecturally, the customer is striving for a goal which makes a lot of sense and I saw many opportunities where I could support our teams to achieve that.

Our mission is to democratise design and empower creativity for anyone and everyone, on every platform!\n\n   Since launch in April 2013 we have grown exponentially, amassing over 10 million users in over 40 languages. We are one of the world\'s fastest growing technology companies. We\'re growing rapidly and building a product that users really love -- just check out Twitter!\n\n   Engineering is a core part of who we are. Working with our existing team of a carefully selected of ex-Google, VMware, ThoughtWorks, and Atlassian engineers, we pride in our focus on software engineering fundamentals and pragmatism. The team strives to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, and to strike a measured balance between getting things done and long term maintainability.\n\n   We also love to have fun. For example, we name our releases alphabetically around themes. We\'ve recently done "cheese of the world", "muppets characters," and "Crayola colours." We\'ve done an Australian slang-themed set of release names that has included "mozzie" (meaning mosquitoes) and "ripper" (meaning really good). Imagine the whole place erupting in laughter when the release cop yells: "Pushing Kermit to Prod!" - it\'s the everyday little things that make Canva an enjoyable place to work and solve problems.\n\n   The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimising performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code. We also have a flat structure where engineers are invited to comment on the direction their peers are taking and are paired for peer-reviewing of code to occur. This ensures that knowledge around the code base is shared and speed of release is quick and efficient. To dig into the in and outs of engineering at Canva, here\'s an article written by our CTO, Dave, discussing how we get things done.\n\n   Finally, if you\'re curious about some of our technology, the Canva backend is a microservices environment, on AWS, built primarily in Java, with a mix of powerful libraries as well as some bespoke components.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n     * As an individual contributor - work closely with your leads, designers, and product managers to deliver great products that delight our 10+ million customers all over the world.\n     * Bring new ideas to the table with respect to how we can streamline processes and build better solutions\n     * Engage in technical discussions and the design and build-out of new features\n     * Identify and address performance bottlenecks within the application and broader infrastructure\n     * Participate in design meetings, interviews, and code reviews\n     * Communicate with other team members to figure out the best solutions to difficult problems\n     * Passion for performance debugging, benchmarking, building awesome things, and picking up new technologies and skills.\n\nRequirements\n\n     * At least 2+ years of commercial experience developing complex web-based applications in Java.

Our goal is to promote a healthy lifestyle through financial rewards. We believe the best way to improve the world's health is to celebrate the health conscious rather than harass and cajole those who are not.\n\nWhat You'll Be Doing\n\n     * Source new opportunities through inbound leads\n     * Gather pertinent information to qualify a lead\n     * Understand client needs and requirements\n     * Route qualified clients to the appropriate sales team member for further development and closure\n     * Unrelenting desire to improve professionally and personally\n     * A positive team-player\n     * Believe your time MUST be spent doing something that matters\n     * An advocate for helping and guiding people\n\nWhat Do We Look For in a Candidate?\n\n     * A personal or family health story that tells us that you really care about this mission.   If you read the current team's bios you will see that each of us has been touched by a personal or family health challenge. Most of us used this challenge to change our health destiny and improve our health. We look for that same level of mission alignment in candidates we meet.\n     * A track record of success.  We believe winners have always won. We believe, too many people have only had success by association. Their resume says they went to Stanford, worked at Google, Uber, etc but it is unclear what they really contributed or accomplished at these places. Our unique interview process helps us identify your lifelong accomplishments and allows you to share your story behind your resume.\n     * Optimism.  There is little need for a devil's advocate at a startup. The whole rest of the world is fighting against you. The inside of a startup should be a bastion of hope and optimism. If you are kind of a curmudgeon this is probably not the place for you.\n\nWhat is it Like to Work Here?\n\n     * Every company boasts about having an amazing culture and an employee friendly environment.  It is hard to tell truth from fiction when you are just reading a job description or cruising their website.  Instead we'll just give you the reasons why we are and doing what matters.\n     * Every employee who joins takes a pledge to celebrate the health conscious while they work here and for the rest of their life.\n     * We don't have a pool table.  Instead we have a gym in the middle of our office.  Not in a side room, not in a corner, it is right in the middle of the entire office.\n     * Our conference room is made up of 4 treadmill desks that face each other so you can do a walking meeting while seeing a presentation, rain or shine.\n     * There is no sugar, candy bars, soda (diet or otherwise) allowed in our office.  If you bring some it will get thrown away.\n     * We do a daily standup where we don't discuss why something is late.  Instead we each spend 10 seconds on what we actually shipped today.\n     * We all leave at 5pm/6pm so we can go to the gym, eat dinner at a healthy hour, and see our kids before they go to sleep.  After 8pm/9pm we get back online and take care of tasks, if needed. Self management is key and required.\n     * We synchronize our PTO so when we are off the whole rest of the company is off. The only way to have a relaxing vacation at an early stage startup is to do it when everyone else is off. We also offer floaters you can use towards your PTO.\n     * We share health articles and health stats and think it is fun not annoying.\n     * We have monthly company outings we haven't all tried before.  The last few were: Zumba, Bubble Soccer, Crossfit, Bikram Yoga, Rock climbing, etc.\n\n   Is this Startup Going to Make It?\n\n   We think so. Our CEO sold his last company to Google for over $120MM.  His prior company to Alibaba.  He was a board member or advisor to over $1B worth of startup exits to companies like Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn, etc.  Past performance may not be indicative of future results, but we like our odds.  We've grown from 23 people and now hovering 100 people in shy of a year; including opening our newest location in San Diego. This isn't because we are spending some of the $23MM+ in financing we received like drunken sailors (in fact we are pretty frugal).  This is because our revenues have been doubling almost every month since we started selling policies in January of last year.\n\n   Apply for this job\n", 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T04:17:05.164858', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

The Estimation Team is responsible for translating noisy signals sent from space into precise location estimates which will be used for the future of automation.\n   The problem, in brief, starts with weak radio signals sent from satellites orbiting earth at 14,000 kmh.  As the signals approach earth they\'re bent by relativistic effects, delayed by ionized particles, and refracted by near surface weather resulting in noisy, biased distance estimates which can be used to produce the location of a receiver.  The Estimation team is responsible for teasing the signal from the noise, we use physical models for the things we know and statistical models to capture the rest with the goal of producing position estimates two orders of magnitude more precise than traditional GPS.\n   The ideal candidate uses words like "correlation" and "posterior" in daily conversation.  They know the names Kalman, Cholesky and Bayes.  When they hear someone say Monte Carlo, they don\'t think of the city.  They have enough experience in academia to know how to perform research, but enough experience in industry to know to start simple and iterate.\n\nIdeal Candidates:\n\n     * Know how to properly evaluate a model.\n     * Hold an advanced degree in Math, Stats, Computer Science, Astronomy or similar.\n     * Always like to learn new things.

All clients receive financial planning through the service, Path, at no additional cost. Wealthfront does not charge management fees on the first $10,000 and for amounts above that the annual management fee is 0.25% - a fraction of what financial advisors charge.

We cultivate an environment that favors agility, initiative, and creative thinking. Our mission is to protect life, making the world a safer place through smart devices and software services. We genuinely love what we do and are looking for others who share this passion.\n\n   Your impact\n   Have you ever wondered if you can write code to save lives? At Axon our mission is to protect life. We are passionate about bringing state of the art technology to law enforcement so officers can focus on helping their communities instead of fighting with bad software.\n\n   As an iOS Developer for Connected Devices you will help us build world-class mobile applications. Our teams are small (but growing), which means you have more ownership over the applications you work on and can guide their direction. We build our applications natively using a mix of Swift, Objective-C (which we are migrating away from), and some C and C++. We believe that our customers deserve the same level of quality and polish in an application that we as consumers expect.\n\n   What types of mobile applications are we building?\n\n   Axon View - this application connects wirelessly to our Body Cameras to provide an easy workflow for officers on patrol. After each recording they may need to review the video and to add additional information that will be included when the video is ultimately uploaded as evidence. It also supplements the officers camera by acting as the GPS when a video is being recorded.\n\n   Axon Capture - Body Cameras provide one way to capture evidence in the field while providing transparency, but there are additional types of evidence that are better served using a mobile application. For example capturing photos and taking witness statements are common activities and while most phones come with application to take pictures, videos, or make audio recordings, they cannot do this in a secure manner that provides security and the appropriate paper trail. Axon Capture has to work with lower level APIs to deliver these sort of capabilities.\n\n   And more - Law Enforcement only recently began rolling out smart phones to all of their officers, in some cases based solely on the mobile applications that we provide. This is just the beginning of what we can do and we have other applications in the R&D process that we need your help to make a reality. Many of the tools we use on a regular basis have a corresponding need in Law Enforcement and Axon is strongly positioned to be the leader in that market.\n   Are you ready to help make a difference?\n\n   We believe in pushing autonomy as deeply as possible into the team. A deep understanding of our customers is critical to achieve this autonomy and move quickly. As a result, every engineer on the team spends personal time with law enforcement officers and agencies. Your first police ride-along will be awesome!\n\nSkills Required\n\n     * 6-10+ years application development work\n     * Significant experience building native iOS applications\n     * 3+ years experience in Objective-C and or Swift\n     * Strong understanding of client & server application design\n     * Driven, focused self-starters who take ownership of their work\n     * You're passionate about mobile software development\n\nSkills Preferred\n\n     * C & C++\n     * Audio & Video programming\n     * Bluetooth Experience (Low Energy and Classic)\n     * Networking and Wi-Fi APIs\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\n     * Medical\n     * Dental\n     * Vision\n     * Life\n     * Stock Options\n     * Bonus plan\n     * Supportive parental leave policy\n     * Unlimited paid-time-off\n     * 401K\n     * Commuter options\n     * Full Pantry\n     * Awarded 14th best place to work in the state of Washington and the geekiest office space in Seattle\n     * Opportunities to ride along with real US police officers in real life situations, see them use technology, and get inspired.\n     * And much more...\n\n   We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

This year we are launching a platform that will allow developers globally to find projects and teams based on their code. We are very excited about what\'s to come and have summarised everything on our blog if you want to read further, you can see at this blog post where all this comes from and read our roadmap.\n\n   We have raised a $6M round last Summer and are rapidly growing our team.\n\n   TEAM\n\n   At the moment, the engineering team consists of four different teams: Data Retrieval (Go and Scala), Platform (Go and JavaScript), Data Science (C++ and Python) and Infrastructure (Go and Python).\n\n   Our infrastructure is built on bare metal servers, with Kubernetes and CoreOS, and stores over +17M git repositories.\n\n   We believe in continuously giving everyone the chance to learn and develop professionally and in building a cohesive team that welcomes every new person. We have monthly get togethers, annual hackathon retreats and regularly attend conferences all over Europe (dotGo, FOSDEM, ReactEurope, etc.)\n\n   ROLE\n\n   The Data Retrieval team is focused on building our data pipeline which allows the other teams to consume the information extracted from the git repositories efficiently. The synchronization and manipulation of more than +17M git repositories is done in Go, using our own git implementation (go-git). The pipeline which is being developed, plans to manage more than 1PB of information using a mix of Scala and Go on top of Spark, HDFS and Parquet. One of our current challenges, for instance, is to extract the AST over billions of files in hundreds of languages.\n\n   At source{d}, we really care about open source, you can easily check a couple of our Data Retrieval team\'s projects below:\n   o  go-git: A low level and highly extensible Git implementation in pure Go.\n   o  siva: seekable indexed block archiver format\n   o  go-billy: the missing interface to abstract several storages.\n\n   If you are interested on how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.\n\n   Good knowledge of distributed computing and parallel processing is important. You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages and very good algorithmic skills. Go is not a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team\'s mindset and prior experience than any specific skills.\n\n   At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from EUR49.000 to EUR53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).\n\n   CULTURE\n\n   source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what\'s best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.\n\n   "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don\'t hire anyone who doesn\'t fit into this culture, it\'s the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.\n\n   At the moment, we\'re 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from the office in Madrid. Although we\'re looking to grow our team in-house at the moment and not accepting remote, we are willing to sponsor your visa if needed and our team is used to helping people relocate to Madrid. We offer support throughout the entire process to you and your family\n\n   Apply for this job\n', 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T04:32:25.390471', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

Our mission is to make mainstream enterprise more efficient in how they build teams and use physical resources. Our approach combines the what we learned at Google and other first tier software companies, with our experiences working with an empowered open source ecosystem.\n\n   While at Google, the Heptio founders (Craig McLuckie and Joe Beda) started an open source project called Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a "container orchestrator" that enables IT organizations to offer API driven services to their organization along with drive up resource utilization. It is also a fast-growing open source community and the "seed crystal" for a groundbreaking set of technologies.\n\n   While the founding team is based in Seattle, Heptio is building a company that fully supports distributed teams. At this time, we are seeking talented people in Seattle, San Francisco and New York City. People with prior experience working effectively in a distributed company are highly desired. Other locations in the United States may be considered if you have a consistent record of delivery and experience collaborating on a distributed team.\n\nWHAT YOU\'LL BE DOING...\n\n     * We are looking for extraordinary engineering talent to continue the mission to bring Kubernetes to enterprise developers and beyond.\n     * Working with and growing your stature in the Kubernetes open source community.\n     * Building distributed server side systems and developer tooling in Go.\n     * Listening to users in order to make complex technologies usable.\n\nYOUR QUALIFICATIONS...\n\n     * You are passionate about distributed systems, APIs, cloud computing and scalability.\n     * You have built server software as an engineer and recognize the challenges, complexities and tradeoffs to be made when building and deploying new systems to production.\n     * You can collaborate on a team to build, review and help design high quality code.\n     * You\'ve demonstrated the ability to effectively work independently.\n     * You are passionate about working with new technology to make many people happier every day.\n     * You are thoughtful about user experience, especially for other engineers.\n\nIT WOULD BE NICE IF...\n\n     * You\'ve worked on or with technologies that make up the new "cloud native" stack. This would include Kubernetes, Docker, Mesosphere, Go.\n     * You have experience at multiple parts of the stack to better understand our customers.\n     * You have previously worked in a large enterprise setting (again, for customer empathy) yet yearn for the opportunities provided by a startup.\n\n   Important: we are an equal opportunity employer and value empathy and inclusion at our company. We\'re strongly committed to providing equal employment opportunity for all employees and all applicants for employment. We want to embody the change we need in our industry.\n\n   Apply for this job\n', 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T04:33:09.180118', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

It is our aim to make it as achievable for a small team of scientists to pursue an ambitious therapeutic R&D initiative as it has become for a small team of programmers to develop and deploy a web-based software product.\n\n   The Emerald Cloud Laboratory (ECL) is a web-based life sciences lab, enabling scientists to move out of the lab, and to instead conduct research remotely from a computer. It empowers scientists to specify experiments with the precision and reproducibility of code, and to abstract away the physical execution of those experiments to Emerald's robotically-driven facility in South San Francisco. Through the ECL, the resulting experimental data is accessible in perpetuity, detailed metadata is linked and explorable, and investigators are equipped with a suite of computational tools to drive of the algorithmic components of data analysis, freeing them to focus on the insights that are uniquely derived by scientists.\n\n   What You'll Do\n\n   The Infrastructure Engineer builds the distributed software systems that support the ECL, and designs the way in which those systems are safely and scalably deployed in Docker containers on AWS. Projects include: building a hybrid object / graph multi-tenant data store that supports describing all standard biology and chemistry experiments in code; building CloudFormation / Docker Compose configurations that enable environment parity between our development and production environments; building a service to safely distribute and execute simulation and analysis code in Emerald's Symbolic Lab Language (SLL). We're a small team, which means it is essential for every team member to be ready to take ownership and lead projects.\n\n   As an early team member helping to build the Engineering team as well as the product, you will also be encouraged to contribute to the software engineering best practices we maintain in our own work, and which we bring to Emerald as a whole. We strive to be continually critical of our process, cutting cruft and homing in on performance multipliers (like continuous integration and agile development practices).\n\n   Our Tech Stack\n\n   Our backend services are written in Go, and deployed on AWS infrastructure in Docker containers. Our applications are modern web applications (Backbone.js / HTML5 / CSS3) running on the desktop (with NW.js) across Windows and Mac OS. Our source code control is on Github, with integration with Travis-CI for continuous testing. SLL and the Experiment Framework are written in the Wolfram Language and Clojure. Our stack is always evolving, and we welcome new ideas and technologies which enhance our ability to deliver incredible software.\n\n   The Infrastructure Engineering role operates mostly in Go, AWS (Postgres RDS, S3, EC2, SQS, CloudFormation, etc.), and Docker. More broadly, bringing online the first cloud-based biotech lab is an expansive, diverse challenge. A core component of our job is consistently determining the right tools for the job at hand, and diving in to learn these new technologies along the way.\n\n   Applying\n\n   If you would like to apply or learn more, we'd love to hear from you! Please follow the link on this page, and include your resume and a remark or two about where you are coming from and why you are interested in Emerald and this role. We will contact you if we think there could be a match.\n\n   Optional but welcome:\n   A link to your Github account or any projects you are proud of can be especially helpful. With project links, please include some explanation to help us get our bearings.\n   Apply for this job\n", 'utc_datetime': '2017-08-31T04:33:16.521893', 'lat': '', 'lng': '', 'country': '', 'employment_type': '', 'remote_ok': '', 'time_commitment': ''}

Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. - Jobs\n\n   Engineering at Crunchbase\n   Our Mission\n   It's nearly impossible to find an authoritative source of truth about companies that is both always up-to-date and freely available. Our mission is to continue building the largest high-quality, live, openly editable and accessible dataset of company and people information in the world -- and to build a delightful product with slick, easy-to-use APIs around that dataset.\n\n   We love building enjoyable user experiences, complex data schemata, APIs, and scalable systems that support tens of millions of interactions per day. Our team is a group of highly skilled engineers working on formidable problems throughout the stack.\n\n   How We Operate\n   We have a flexible model for team organization at Crunchbase, centered around the principles of agile software development, allowing us to fluidly adapt to new requirements and situations as they arise. We tend towards two main types of teams:\n\n   o Feature-oriented teams:operate independently and own their projects from cradle to grave, building everything they need to execute. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their responsibility to make sure the business needs are met all the way into production.\n   o Function-oriented teams: provide support to feature teams and have deeper expertise on particular parts of the stack. It's their responsibility to build platforms that are so good the other teams want to use them, rather than being forced into it.\n\n   We also ship code as early as we possibly can; getting betas into customer hands is a top priority. Our goal is to tune our process to customer needs as efficiently and quickly as possible. Crunchbase is built with a variety of tools - a core part of our engineering philosophy is to use the right tool for the job:\n   o Ruby, Scala, Java\n   o Node.js, Angular.js, Typescript\n   o Redis, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch\n   o Git, Nginx, Docker, NewRelic, Jenkins\n   o AWS - EC2, ELB, VPC, S3, R53, RDS, SQS, etc.\n\n   Frontend Engineering at Crunchbase\n   Crunchbase is more than just a dataset -- we're building a platform that enables companies and people to come together and reach one another regardless of where they are in the world.\n\n   User Interface and User Experience are the key drivers helping us to achieve this vision. We care deeply about creating something that feels right in every detail, and we're looking for engineers with either a solid design aesthetic or a passion for front-end componentry to help us go faster. The responsibilities of front-end engineers at Crunchbase include:\n   o Build single page web applications that are flexible, composable, metadata-driven, and able to rapidly adapt to new business requirements.\n   o Collaboratively drive user experience and design decisions with the product team to create interfaces our customers love.\n   o Create high-performance experiences that exceed both our perceived-perf and wall-clock-perf requirements.\n   o Maintain clean, fast, easy-to-understand CSS and component architectures.\n   o Implement best practices in frontend unit, functional and integration testing in a highly API-driven environment.\n\n   Qualifications\n   o Solid understanding of computer science and software engineering fundamentals.\n   o Motivated to participate in ongoing learning and growth through pair programming, code reviews, application of new technologies and best practices.\n   o Excellent verbal and written communication skills.\n   o Familiarity with tools we presently use is a plus, but not required -- if you know something better, we may use that instead!\n\n   What Crunchbase offers\n   o  Competitive salary and equity\n   o  A team of creative, transparent entrepreneurs driven to accomplish our mission\n   o  Daily catered lunches\n   o  Fitness reimbursement (to work off the catered lunches)\n   o  Unlimited Paid Time Off (PTO) -- we don't track vacation days\n   o  Incredible medical, vision and dental benefits for employees and their families\n   o  401(k) and Roth plans, and free annual financial adviser check-in\n   o  Free One Medical Group membership for employees and their families\n   o  Commuter benefits program\n   o  Free UberX rides anywhere in the Bay Area after late nights at the office\n   o  Prime location in the SoMa district of SF, near CalTrain, and Muni stops\n   o  Company and team offsites, retreats, events and happy hours\n\n   Every day our team is honored to work with entrepreneurs and innovators from every corner of the globe, and we aim to build a team that reflects the diversity of our customers. Each individual at Crunchbase brings their own perspectives, work experiences, lifestyles, and cultures with them, and we believe that a more diverse team creates more innovative products, provides a better service to its customers, and helps us all grow and learn as individuals.

Our marketplace has an abundance of one-of-a-kind items from independent artists, designers and vintage collectors from around the world. Our challenge? Make it easier for buyers to find these remarkable goods and for creative entrepreneurs to run their businesses. Do you have the skills, passion and empathy to take on this task? Are you excited about building products that thrill our buyers and empower millions of small businesses?\n\n   About the Team\n   The technical staff at Etsy believes that code is craft, and that the work we do is part of a larger creative culture represented by the hundreds of thousands of inspired artists and designers who make Etsy such a unique marketplace. We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. We believe in measuring everything, taking advantage of our pioneering continuous deployment system to ship code early and often, and a blameless culture based on trust and a commitment to learning. We primarily write in PHP and JavaScript as well as in Go and Java. Our product engineering teams have recently shipped projects like a unified and redesigned set of seller tools, a better recommendation and personalization experience for buyers, and a system to allow buyers and sellers to communicate more effectively about variations on their orders. Learn more about our engineering philosophies, tools, and some of the challenges we\'ve been solving on our Engineering blog:\n   http://codeascraft.com/\n\n   About the Role\n   You\'ll be helping us build delightful products and experiences for people buying and selling with Etsy. In the Senior Full-Stack Engineering role you will be contributing at all levels of our web application stack, ranging from back-end technologies (PHP, MySQL, Memcache) to front-end web interfaces (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The teams working on each feature are small, so there\'s a lot of meaningful collaboration between engineers, product managers, and designers.\n\n   We believe strongly in using both quantitative and qualitative methods to guide decisions. To that end, you\'ll be able to use our in-house analytics tools to gather information and gain insights. With a strong focus on creative entrepreneurs, you will work closely alongside our research team, go on studio visits, and discover insights in our forums. You\'ll also be able to use Etsy\'s Continuous Deployment architecture to push code to production early and often (and you\'ll probably push in your first week here).\n\n   About You\n   You\'re an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely reliable code that other people - or you, six months into the future - will find easy to comprehend and modify. You believe in the connective power of Etsy\'s peer-to-peer marketplace and helping creative entrepreneurs scale their business to achieve their dreams.\n\n   About the Location\n   Our engineers are concentrated in our Brooklyn HQ and San Francisco offices, but are located all over the US. We believe that open communication and effective teamwork can happen regardless of where you sit, and we\'ll provide you with tools to make sure that happens. Your laptop will come with our video conferencing software pre-installed, so you can always join in on meetings and catch up face-to-face with your team regardless of where in the world you or they are.\n\nYou will be successful in this role if you:\n\n     * Can define and solve unconstrained problems, and know when to seek help when no progress is being made.\n     * Are comfortable collaborating closely with product managers and designers, providing estimates or product ideas that will influence your team\'s roadmap.\n     * Have a "leave it better than you found it" mentality, and are willing to work with and improve on code you did not originally write.\n     * Love to experiment and use data to drive decision-making.\n     * Are generous with your time and experience, and can mentor other engineers.\n     * Will be a mindful, transparent, and communicative member of your team.\n\n   What\'s Next\n   Interested in joining the team? Send us a cover letter and your resume explaining why you\'d be great for the job. We value individuality and variety, so make sure to tell us what you\'re all about. If you have an online presence (blog, Twitter, Facebook), send it along. And if you write, draw, craft, or contribute to something you\'re proud of, we\'d love to hear about it.\n\n   Etsy is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and will consider all qualified applicants regardless of color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital or family status, disability, gender identity or expression, veteran status, actual or presumed belonging to an ethnic group, or any other legally protected status.
